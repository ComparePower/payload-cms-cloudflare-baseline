### Electricity Price Trends in Abilene

Unlike other states, Texas has a deregulated energy market. In 2002, the state deregulated the market to decrease prices for residential and commercial consumers. This policy change means there are dozens of competitors for Abilene customers rather than a single provider.

The result is that a homeowner or business owner in Abilene can find inexpensive rates from companies competing for new accounts. ComparePower allows you to compare rate quotes from multiple providers in one place. This online tool makes shopping, selecting, and saving on your plan simple.

## How to Find the Best Energy Plan in Abilene

Knowing your monthly energy usage is the best way to shop for better rates in Abilene. Why?

The "price per kWh" energy companies advertise for exact monthly usage.

Every plan calculates your monthly bill differently, meaning your bill may vary significantly from provider to provider.

Unless you use the advertised amount of energy per month, you will pay a different price from your initial quote.

Fortunately, there's a better way to shop for power.

The best way to shop for an affordable electricity rate in Abilene is to calculate your monthly usage over the previous year. With this information, ComparePower will handle the rest of your research.

The site puts you in control by bringing all possible providers and their quotes to your computer screen. ComparePower's search tool shows base prices and fees and charges often left to the fine print.

ComparePower also lets you sign up with your chosen provider without ever leaving the site. You only need your zip code and monthly usage rate to get started.


<Image src="unknown.jpg" alt="Abilene Electricity Rates" />

**If you don't know your usage, estimate**

If you cannot acquire 12 months of usage, or you're the owner of a new home, the next best thing is to estimate how much energy you will use each month.

Estimating your average usage is not ideal, but it is better than choosing the first plan you see advertised by an electricity provider that doesn't meet your needs.

Use ComparePower to find the best energy plan for*your**specific usage*.

## Moving to Abilene: Setting up Electricity

Abilene is home to more than 120,000 people. From first-time homeowners to business owners, Abilene residents enjoy their lives in West Texas. The city hosts the West Texas Fair and Rodeo, the Western Heritage Classic, and events at Abilene Christian University. Abilene not only embraces its roots as a stop on the Texas and Pacific Railroad but its role as home to universities and world-class hospitals.

**Important:**If this is your first time setting up electricity service in Abilene, you should determine the average monthly usage for your new home over the previous year.

The property's previous owner can usually provide this information based on energy bills.

Acquiring usage information may take some time and effort, but you stand to save hundreds to thousands of dollars per year.

ComparePower will crunch the numbers to help you find the best plan for your home's usage level.

**Note:**If you can't obtain exact usage figures, estimate your monthly usage instead. Utilize our "Help Me Choose" tool when you enter your zip code below, and we'll help you determine your home's usage.

## Switching Electricity Companies in Abilene

Switching energy plans can be very beneficial to you. Because market conditions are constantly changing, it is important to shop for a lower rate every year when your contract is about to expire. Your current provider will take the end of your contract as an opportunity to raise rates.


<Image src="unknown.jpg" alt="Abilene Electricity Rates" />

Before renewing your contract, check the rates of competing electricity providers. Switching can save you a lot of money.

**Switching is easy:**

- You don't have to call your current company to end the contract
- No one bothers you at home
- Your lights won't go out
- It doesn't take more than a few minutes

When you switch providers, your new electric company will handle everything, including canceling your current plan.

There is no loss of power when you switch. Electricity in Abilene is delivered by the AEP North Transmission and Distribution Utility. The hardware that delivers electricity to your home does not change when you switch providers.

In Texas, you can end your current energy contract within 14 days of expiration without any penalties. You may also be able to set up a new contract start date within 60 days of your contract expiration with most companies. It's also possible that ending your contract and incurring a penalty might be offset by savings with your new provider.

When you reach out, your previous year's usage helps you find your best rate.
