 ### Electricity Price Trends in Abilene
 
 Unlike other states, Texas has a deregulated energy market. In 2002, the state deregulated the market to decrease prices for residential and commercial consumers. This policy change means there are dozens of competitors for Abilene customers rather than a single provider.

 **If you don't know your usage, estimate**
 
 If you cannot acquire 12 months of usage, or you're the owner of a new home, the next best thing is to estimate how much energy you will use each month.
 
 Estimating your average usage is not ideal, but it is better than choosing the first plan you see advertised by an electricity provider that doesn't meet your needs.

 ## Switching Electricity Companies in Abilene
 
 Switching energy plans can be very beneficial to you. Because market conditions are constantly changing, it is important to shop for a lower rate every year when your contract is about to expire. Your current provider will take the end of your contract as an opportunity to raise rates.
 
-<Image src="Electricity_Rates_Switch_Save.jpg" alt="Abilene Electricity Rates" />
 
+<Image src="unknown.jpg" alt="Abilene Electricity Rates" />
+
 Before renewing your contract, check the rates of competing electricity providers. Switching can save you a lot of money.
 
 **Switching is easy:**
 
 - You don't have to call your current company to end the contract
-
 - No one bothers you at home
-
 - Your lights won't go out
-
 - It doesn't take more than a few minutes
 
 When you switch providers, your new electric company will handle everything, including canceling your current plan.
