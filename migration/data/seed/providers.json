    "_mdxContent": "\n## Finding your best energy company has never been easier.\n\nAlthough retail electricity choice today is largely driven by price, it is not the only factor determining why customers elect to stay with their current provider or switch to another.\n\nProviders that understand their customers’ experiences and the relative performance of their competitors are better able to target offerings and services that may increase overall customer satisfaction, retailer loyalty, and advocacy.\n\n**Contents:**\n\n## Performance Score\n\ndfddf\n\n## Highest in overall customer satisfaction\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zipcode to instantly compare Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n## What is the best energy company in Texas?\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Compare Reliant electricity plans in Houston.**\" />\n\n## Which is the cheapest energy company?\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Compare Reliant electricity plans in Dallas.**\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Compare Reliant electricity plans in Corpus Christi.**\" />\n\n## How to choose the best electricity company for your home\n\nPicking the wrong Reliant Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n### **The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complex, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Help me Choose\" classname=\"in_post_guideme\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code and we'll guide you to your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n## Texas electricity plans\n\nWhether you’re moving to a new home or apartment, looking to save on weekends, earn rewards, or lower your electricity bill, energy companies in Texas offer an array of plans to meet your energy needs.\n\nReliant offers the following electricity plans and services:\n\n**Fixed-Rate Plans**  \nPrice protection of a fixed rate.\n\n**Month-to-Month plans**  \nNo long-term contracts or cancellation fees.\n\n**Prepaid Plans**  \nUse only as much energy as you need.\n\n**Renewable Plans**  \nGenerated from 100% renewable sources.\n\n**Solar Plans**  \nHomes with solar panels can earn and sell back bill credits for any excess electricity returned to the grid.\n\n**ePlans**  \nSave money when you sign up for online conveniences.\n\n**Average Billing**  \nAvoid seasonal bill spikes and make managing your monthly budget easier with average billing.\n\n**Pay-as-you-go**   \nPay-as-you-go electricity for customers with Smart Meters.\n\n## Reliant electricity services\n\n  Online Account Management  \n  Make a Payment  \n  Enroll in Auto-Pay  \n  Move Your Service  \n  Change Your Plan  \n  Usage History\n\n## Best customer service\n\nReliant's call center is recognized as one of the top 10 call centers in North America by the BenchmarkPortal. As the recipient of multiple excellence awards, Reliant leads the way in providing an outstanding experience and digital innovation to its customers.\n\nReliant’s dedication to outstanding customer satisfaction is recognized by the following awards:\n\n- 2017 Tempkin CX Excellence Award Winner\n\n- 2017 MartizCX Elite Award\n\n- 2017 Dynatrace Digital Transformation Performance Award\n\nQuestions about your Reliant electricity account?

ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commission of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Reliant on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/us/tx/houston/profile/electric-companies/reliant-energy-0915-2429).\n\n- Read customer complaints about [Reliant on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=ELSQL01DB1245229100027&TXT_BEGIN=12/1/2018&TXT_END=5/31/2019)\n\n## Shop electricity by zip code\n\nSearch low electricity rates by zip code.

Think about how you use your energy and what matters to you. Sometimes paying a bit more for peace of mind or to support renewable energy is worth it.\n\nReady to find a power plan that fits your needs?

It's smart to compare plans and read recent reviews before making your choice.\n\n### Direct Energy vs. Constellation: Reddit Feedback\n\nBased on online discussions, including Reddit, here's what people are saying:\n\nDirect Energy often gets positive mentions for budget-friendly options. However, some users report challenges with customer service, particularly when it comes to resolving billing issues.\n\nConstellation receives mixed reviews. Many praise their competitive initial rates and plan variety. However, some customers warn about unexpected rate hikes after introductory periods and hidden fees on bills.\n\nA few users mentioned challenges with customer service, including long wait times, and difficulties canceling contracts without incurring hefty fees.\n\nThe main takeaway? Do your research. Don't just pick the cheapest plan and hope for the best. What works for one person might not be the best fit for you.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

Take your time comparing plans carefully before you commit.\n\nThose attractive intro rates aren't the whole story - compare all your options so you get the best plan for your home.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

Reliant gets props for being reliable and having a slick mobile app, but folks aren't thrilled about their prices.\n\nMany Redditors feel like they're paying extra just for the Reliant name.\n\nCirro, on the other hand, is the budget-friendly pick. Users love their wallet-friendly rates, but some say the customer service could use a boost.\n\nHere's the kicker: both companies catch flak for hiking up rates after the intro period. It's like a Texas-sized bait and switch!\n\nThe takeaway? Do your homework, compare plans carefully, and always read the fine print. Your perfect power match is out there, but you might need to dig a little to find it.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

Both are big players in the Texas electricity game, but they've got their own quirks.\n\nReliant gets a pat on the back for their customer service. Folks say they're pretty upfront about things, which is always nice. But here's the kicker - their prices might make your wallet a bit lighter than some other options.\n\nTheir \"free nights\" plans? Some people swear by 'em, others think they're just clever marketing.\n\nDirect Energy, on the other hand, often wins the price game. If you're watching your pennies, they might be your best bet. But watch out - their customer service gets some side-eye. Some users have had real headaches sorting out billing issues and disputes.\n\nThe main advice?\n\nDo your homework, y'all. Remember, the cheapest plan isn't always the best if it's giving you gray hairs from frustration. And what works for your neighbor might not be the best fit for your home.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

Do your homework.\n\nCompare plans and find what works for you. Just remember – what's perfect for your neighbor might not be the best fit for your home.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

Do your homework.\n\nCompare plans and find what works for you. Remember, your neighbor's perfect plan might not be the best fit for your home.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

Same Power, Different Name**. Whether with [TXU](/providers/texas-electricity-energy-companies/txu-energy-plans-electricity-rates/), [Reliant](/providers/texas-electricity-energy-companies/reliant-energy-plans-electricity-rates/), or [a smaller company](/providers/texas-electricity-energy-companies/), your electricity is delivered by the same company—your TDU.\n\n[TDUs](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity, such as [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas.\n\nThe [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates them.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with.\n\nThe brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive—so [why pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised Rates Are a Trap**. You’ve likely seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nYour electricity usage fluctuates every month, so the rate you see [may not](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/) [be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\nThe [advertised rate](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) looks great on paper but is often impossible to hit in real life.\n\n**3\\. Beware of Holdover Rates**. When your contract expires and you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you are subject to a [holdover rate,](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/) which is often sky-high.\n\nDuring Texas heatwaves or winter storms, this can be a costly mistake.\n\nAvoid letting your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Rather than shopping directly on an electricity provider’s website, where you only see their rates, it is wiser to use a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n## So, What’s the Big Idea?\n\n**Forget the brand name.** It's not important.\n\nWhat matters is choosing a plan that matches your usage, not the one with the biggest ad budget.\n\nThe electricity is the same no matter which company you choose.\n\n**Your real goal?** Find the best plan for your household’s usage.\n\n## Compare Power\n\nYou’re not just comparing TXU to Reliant.\n\nYou’re looking for a plan that fits your lifestyle.\n\nConnect your home with **[Live Link™](https://comparepower.com/live-link/)**, and see which plan gives you the best rate.\n\nIt’s personalized to your usage—so no more guessing.\n\n### Find Real Savings\n\n**Get the plan that fits your home.

Regions throughout the state were controlled by energy monopolies prior to deregulation. After the law, energy was deregulated and companies are now fiercely competing for the business of Texas resident. \n\nWith deregulation, comes the power to choose. In any given area, residents have the option to choose from hundreds of plans. While this may seem overwhelming, ComparePower is a free consumer tool that is here to help. They do all the hard work to make sure you get the best rates.\n\nFrom researching and calling to filling in spreadsheets and doing calculations, ComparePower saves you the time and money that these difficult tasks would have cost. They even go above and beyond what you could do on your own by disclosing hidden fees and charges. You can now see the exact rates you’ll pay with one company and compare them “apples to apples” with another provider. \n\n \n\n### Compare Acacia Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nAcacia Energy is a budget retail electricity provider based in Sugar Land, Texas.

This means that the power to choose has been put into your hands and you are able to shop for the rates and plans that best meet your needs. Make sure that you do your research before choosing an Ambit Energy plan.\n\nComparePower can help you do the research and comparisons that ensure you are getting the best rates for your area.

Read this before you take the plunge.\n\nAmbit Energy sales consultants locate customers, educate them about how much money they can expect to save and tell prospects about the opportunity to earn money by becoming a part of their sales team.\n\nSales consultants recoup their investment and make extra money through incentives called customer acquisition bonuses. Consultants earn bonuses by signing up customers and having them refer their friends and family.\n\nThe compensation varies depending on what state you're in. However, the average payment for a consultant is reported to be around 1% of each new sign-up.\n\nAmbit also requires consultants to have at least 20 active customers paying for energy before they can receive commissions. That means you need to convince 20 people to switch companies before you can even be paid.\n\nMulti-Level Marketing requires a firm knowledge of direct sales tactics and hard selling - which is not ideal for most people and definitely not for newbies. It’s difficult to get started unless you already have a large network of people waiting to buy from you.\n\n### **ComparePower affiliate program**\n\nIf you are serious about earning income selling energy in Texas you should consider the ComparePower Affiliate Program.\n\nOur affiliate program offers an opportunity to sell the plans of dozens of electricity providers in Texas.  No costly initial entrance or monthly fees are required.

With a deregulated market, retail energy companies are free to sell their services wherever they please. That means that there are hundreds of providers competing for your business. This drives prices down and gives you the power to choose.\n\nAlthough this may sound like an insurmountable task, ComparePower is here to help. It is a no-cost consumer service that has been around since 2009 and it is dedicated to helping you get the lowest possible rates for electricity. ComparePower knows there has never been a better time to shop for a new energy provider and they do the work so you don’t have to.\n\nHours of calculations and research go into the rates that ComparePower displays on its site. They even know about hidden fees and factor in that information so that you can compare each rate and plan “apples to apples.”\n\n \n\n### Compare American Light & Power rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nAmerican Light & Power was founded in 2007 to serve customers throughout the state. This Houston-based retail electricity provider serves residential and commercial customers.\n\nAmerican Light & Power has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting an American Light & Power plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### American Light & Power residential plans\n\nAmerican Light and Power offers a few basic plans designed for budget-conscious residential customers. The company's standard 12-month plan features a fixed rate with bills based on monthly usage. American Light and Power also provides a month-to-month plan for customers in need of flexibility.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n \n\n### American Light & Power **business plans**\n\nProspective commercial customers will not find standard rates or plans on the American Light and Power website. The company's customer support team accepts online requests for information that yield customized quotes based on energy usage and location.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### American Light & Power **customer service & bill payment**\n\nAmerican Light and Power's customer service representatives can be reached at (832) 804-7500. The customer service email at care@americanlp.com is also available for billing or account questions.\n\nAmerican Light and Power offers the following payment methods for customers:\n\n- **Pay online:** The company's online accounts allow customers to pay by debit or credit card.\n- **Pay by Phone:** Call the toll-free number 855-580-8909 available 24/7.\n- **Pay by Mail:** Mails checks to the following address: American Light and Power, PO Box 660846, Dallas, TX 75266.\n- **Pay in Person:** Customers can pay in person at any ACE Cash Express Store.\n\n \n\n### **American Light & Power reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for American Light and Power?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [American Light and Power on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/electric-companies/american-light-power-in-houston-tx-90034108).\n- Read customer complaints about [American Light and Power on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=ELSQL01DB1245439900003&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018)\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

Some folks love their prices and customer service, while others have had some beef with wonky bills and confusing contract terms. Make sure you’ve done your homework before deciding if they're the right fit for you.\n\n**Does Amigo Energy offer customer support in Spanish?**\n\nIf you're more comfortable chatting it up in Spanish, call their customer service and ask for a Spanish-speaking rep.

The legislation was enacted in 2002 and prices have been dropping ever since. There has never been a better time to switch.\n\nWith all of these choices, you will need some help deciding which provider and plan are best for you. That is where comparepower.comes in. For the last 9 years, it has been the go-to tool for those shopping for electricity.\n\nInstead of spending hours doing research and calculations, you can let ComparePower do the work. In a matter of seconds, you can compare, side by side, all of the service providers and plans available in your area.\n\n \n\n### Compare APG&E rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nAPG&E is a Houston-based retail energy provider that was founded in 2004. This company serves residential and commercial customers in Texas along with five other states.\n\nAPG&E has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting an APG&E plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage.

This form results in a customized quote based on the customer's energy usage and business profile.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### APG&E **customer service & bill payment**\n\nAPG&E's customer support team is available Monday through Saturday for questions or payments by phone at 1-877-544-4857.

ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [APG&E on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/electric-companies/ap-gas-electric-in-houston-tx-90045582).\n- Read customer complaints about [APG&E on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=ELSQL01DB1245343300002&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018).\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

But no stress – this guide's here to help.\n\nWe'll walk you through your options so you can find what fits you perfectly.\n\n### Electricity Plan 101 for Texas Apartments: Fixed or Variable? That's the Question\n\nIn the Lone Star State, you've got two main choices for your electricity plan: fixed-rate or variable-rate.\n\nPicture this: with a fixed-rate plan, your electricity rate is like your rent – it stays the same every month. The only thing that impacts your bill is your usage.\n\nBut with a variable-rate plan, your rate will change each month, kind of like how gas prices go up and down.\n\nAwesome when prices are down, but watch out, as your bills could climb when rates rise.\n\n### Picking Your Perfect Electricity Provider for Your Texas Pad\n\nPicking an electricity provider goes beyond just the price.\n\nConsider their customer service reputation, watch out for any hidden fees, and check out the perks tailored for apartment living.\n\nRemember, the cheapest option isn't always the best deal in the long run.\n\n### Apartment Electricity FAQs\n\n**What should I consider when choosing the best electricity plan for my apartment?**\n\nConsider your electricity use and your budget.\n\nFixed-rate plans give you consistent pricing, while variable-rate plans offer more flexibility but can be less stable in terms of cost.\n\nAnd don’t worry about matching your contract to your lease. Any time you move you can cancel your plan without extra fees.\n\n**How do fixed-rate and variable-rate plans differ?**\n\nFixed-rate plans secure your electricity rate, guaranteeing steady bills for the length of your contract.\n\nOn the flip side, variable-rate plans change with the market, which might save you money when rates drop but could hike up your expenses if rates climb.\n\n**What should I know about setting up new electricity service in my apartment?**\n\nKeep an eye on setup fees, shop on Compare Power regardless of recommendations, and get a clear understanding of how billing works for your particular living situation.\n\nTry to schedule your start date ahead of time. Most apartment complexes will require you to get an electricity plan before you get your keys.\n\n**Are there differences in electricity needs for apartments versus houses?**\n\nYes, apartments often use less electricity because they're smaller and share some infrastructure, which can affect which type of plan is most cost-effective for you.\n\n**Can I switch electricity providers? Are there penalties?**\n\nYou can switch providers anytime, just keep an eye out for any early termination fees. The last two weeks of your contract let you switch without getting charged.\n\nWant to dive deeper into apartment electricity?\n\nCheck out our rundown on [](https://comparepower.com/green-renewable-energy-companies-plans-rates/)[Apartment Electricity Plans](https://comparepower.com/apartment-electricity/)\n\n## How to Choose the Best Electricity Company\n\nWant the best electricity company for your home? Shop with your usage.\n\nHere's how ⤵️\n\n<WpBlock77727_CpVideoPopup />\n\n### Tips for Choosing the Right Plan\n\nNow that you've got the scoop on the best companies for customer service, here are some pointers to help you decide:\n\n**Think about how much energy you use**: Figure out your energy use to pick a plan that fits without paying too much.\n\nNot sure about your electricity usage? No worries! Just head over to our [kWh calculator](https://comparepower.com/kwh-electricity-energy-usage-calculator/) – it's like having a super-smart friend help you figure it out.\n\n**Compare prices and how long the plan lasts**: Check out different plans to find the one that feels right for you in terms of cost and time. Sometimes a longer plan can save you more money.\n\n👉 FYI: You can cancel your contract without an Early Termination Fee any time you move.\n\n**Keep an eye on the rate per kWh**: there might be different rates for using more or less.\n\n**Be alert for extra fee:**, like if you decide to leave the contract early or if there's a minimum amount of energy you need to use.\n\n**Think about the environment**: If you care about being green, check out plans that use renewable energy.\n\n**Make sure they've got your back**: Good customer service is key for those times you need a hand.\n\n## Simplify Power Connections in Your Rental\n\nMaking electricity setup a breeze begins with picking a provider that gets apartment living.\n\nUse Compare Power to check out different companies and their plans, finding competitive prices, satisfaction promises, and perks that suit renters perfectly.\n\nThen, enjoy smooth sign-up with one of Texas' best electricity providers for apartment residents.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Get Started\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Rates Near You\" />\n\n<WpBlock61154_Feedback />\n",

We've all been through the drill: blazing hot summers and those chilly winters.\n\nBut guess what? You can save a lot on your electricity bills by using usage discounts.\n\nThis guide will show you how. Let's dive in and make saving money as straightforward as possible.\n\n### How to Rock Bill Credits\n\nBill credits give you a break on your bill when you use more electricity, but only up to a certain point.\n\nFor example, using more than 1,000 kWh monthly could mean a lower rate for you.\n\nIt's an effective way to save money by adjusting when you use your electricity.\n\n**Diving Into Rates and Usage**: Each electricity provider offers different discount deals.\n\nSome may offer significant savings once you hit 2,000 kWh, which is perfect for large households but might not benefit someone living alone as much.\n\n**How to Maximize Discounts Through Smart Use**: Review your previous electricity bills to get an idea of your average usage.\n\nThen, consider timing your major electricity-consuming activities, like using the air conditioner, to coincide with those discount periods.\n\n**Strategies for Optimal Savings**: Tools like programmable thermostats, energy-efficient appliances, and smart home systems can be beneficial.\n\nRunning your dishwasher or washing machine during off-peak hours when lower rates can lead to substantial savings.\n\n### Common Concerns About Bill Credit Plans\n\n**\"What if I don't use enough electricity to qualify for the discounts?\"**\n\nDon't worry. Many providers offer usage discount plans with tiers starting as low as 500 kWh per month, so even smaller households can benefit.\n\n**\"Will I be penalized for using too much power?\"**\n\nNope. Usage discount plans are designed to reward you for your consumption, not penalize you.\n\nThe more electricity you use, the more you can save.\n\n**\"Are these plans more expensive than regular fixed-rate plans?\"**\n\nNot necessarily. While some usage discount plans may have slightly higher base rates, the bill credits can compensate for the difference, especially if you consistently hit the usage milestones.\n\n### Getting the Best Contract and Rates\n\n**Contract Tips**: The duration of your electricity contract can significantly impact your ability to secure discounts.\n\nWhile longer contracts may offer more appealing terms and discounts, it's important to consider potential changes in your energy usage over time.\n\n**Finding the Best Deals**: Monitoring trends in the Texas energy market can help you determine the optimal time to lock in a rate.\n\nTypically, electricity rates drop during the cooler spring and fall seasons.\n\n### Dodging Hidden Fees in Bill Credit Plans\n\n**Keeping an Eye Out for Hidden Fees**: Look for any sneaky charges that could nibble away at your savings.\n\nKeep an eye open for minimum usage charges or additional fees for high electricity use.\n\n**Understanding the Details**: Review your electricity contract to grasp all the nuances thoroughly.\n\nFocus particularly on the rates' structure, any base fees, and the fine points of the usage discounts.\n\n## Bill Credits FAQs\n\n**How do I tailor my electricity use for discounts?**\n\nPinpoint the major energy consumers in your home. Consider running appliances like washing machines during off-peak hours to take advantage of usage discounts.\n\n**What are typical discount thresholds in Texas?**\n\nThey typically begin at 1,000 kWh, with additional tiers at higher consumption levels, such as 2,000 kWh.\n\n**Are discounts available in all plan types?**\n\nPrimarily found in fixed-rate plans, though some variable-rate options also include them. It's always best to confirm with your provider.\n\n**How can I track my electricity use?**\n\nMany Texas providers offer online tools or apps for live usage tracking. You can also sign up for an account on Smart Meter Texas to access your usage in 15-minute increments.\n\n**Do green plans have similar discounts?**\n\nAbsolutely. Lots of renewable energy plans now come with attractive usage discounts.\n\nThese can be even more beneficial if you sync your high usage periods with times when green energy is plentiful.\n\n**Can I switch to a usage discount plan if I'm currently under contract with another provider?**\n\nIt depends on your current contract. Some providers may allow you to switch plans mid-contract, while others may charge an early termination fee.\n\nCheck with your current provider to understand your options.\n\n**Are there any fees associated with usage discount plans?**\n\nMost usage discount plans don't have any additional fees beyond the standard base charges and energy rates.\n\nHowever, carefully reviewing your contract and asking your provider about any hidden fees is always a good idea.\n\n## How to Choose the Best Bill Credits Company\n\nWant the best electricity for your home? Shop with your usage.\n\nHere's how ⤵️\n\n<WpBlock77727_CpVideoPopup />\n\n### Tips for Choosing the Right Company\n\nNow that you've explored the top companies for customer service and figured out how to shop based on your usage, here are some tips to help you make your choice:\n\n- Pick a plan based on your kWh usage: Know your energy consumption to choose a good fit without overpaying the plan. If you're new to the place and unsure about your usage, our [**kWh calculator**](https://comparepower.com/kwh-electricity-energy-usage-calculator/) can help.\n\n- Compare rates and contract lengths: Compare various plans to find one that matches your price and contract duration needs.\n\n- Watch out for hidden fees: Look into any additional charges, like penalties for early contract termination or minimum usage fees.\n\n- Hunt for special deals: Keep an eye on promotions or discounts that can lower your energy bills.\n\n- Consider green energy options: If eco-friendliness matters to you, search for plans powered by renewable energy.\n\n- Read customer reviews: Customer feedback can offer valuable insights into a company's service quality and customer satisfaction.\n\n- Ensure top-notch customer service: Choose a provider known for reliable support when needed.\n\n- Opt for plans with online account management: The convenience of handling your account online lets you stay informed and in control effortlessly.\n\n## Your Turn to Save\n\nReady to turn your energy usage into savings?\n\nCheck out our top picks for usage discount plans in Texas and start putting money back in your pocket today.\n\nGet more out of what you spend on electricity with these leading providers offering usage discounts and bill credits.\n\nIt's not just about footing the bill for power; it's about earning rewards for it.\n\nChoose the right plan, and every kWh you use turns into savings.\n\nThis way, your energy bill becomes a bit more manageable every month.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Get Started\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Rates Near You\" />\n\n<WpBlock61154_Feedback />\n",

Many electricity providers in Texas allow you to combine free nights and weekends plans with renewable energy sources, so you can save money and go green simultaneously.\n\n**Are there extra fees during peak hours?**\n\nYour per-kWh rate during peak hours will remain fixed according to your plan.\n\nHowever, some plans may have higher rates during peak hours, so it's crucial to carefully review the plan details before enrolling.\n\n**How can I keep track of my energy use?**\n\nYou can keep track of your old bills, peek at **[Smart Meter Texas](https://comparepower.com/smart-meter-texas/)**, or try out Live Link™ by creating an account here on Compare Power.\n\n**How will these plans change my electricity bill?**\n\nThe impact on your electricity bill will depend on how much you can shift your usage to the free hours.\n\nThe more you can move your consumption to off-peak times, the more you'll save. However, you'll still be charged for any energy during peak hours.\n\n**Can smart devices make these plans even better?**\n\nAbsolutely. Smart devices like programmable thermostats, plugs, and smart appliances can automatically adjust your energy usage to align with your free hours, helping you optimize your savings.\n\n**What happens if I use electricity during peak hours?**\n\nIf you consume electricity during peak hours, you'll be charged the plan's regular per-kWh rate for that usage.\n\nTo minimize costs, try shifting as much of your consumption as possible to free off-peak hours.\n\n**Can I switch to a different plan or provider if I'm unsatisfied with my free nights and weekends plan?**\n\nYes, you can switch plans or providers if you're unhappy with your current one.\n\nHowever, be mindful of any early termination fees that may apply, as outlined in your plan details.\n\n**How do I know if a free nights and weekends plan is best for my household?**\n\nTo determine if a free nights and weekends plan is right for you, analyze your household's energy usage patterns and consider whether you can shift significantly to off-peak hours.\n\nIf you're unsure, try using our kWh calculator to estimate your usage and potential savings, or contact one of our energy experts for personalized advice.\n\n## Choosing Your Perfect Company\n\nWhen choosing a free night and weekend electricity company, look for one that offers free hours that align with your daily routine and energy usage patterns.\n\nConsider factors like the company's reputation, customer service quality, and any additional perks or benefits they provide.\n\nRemember, the key to finding the best electricity plan is to shop based on your unique usage habits.\n\nHere's how ⤵️\n\n<WpBlock77727_CpVideoPopup />\n\n### Tips for Picking the Right Plan\n\nArmed with the knowledge of our top picks for customer service and how to shop based on your usage, here are some additional tips to help you choose the perfect free nights and weekends plan:\n\n- **Determine your kWh usage**: Understanding how much energy you consume can help you select a plan that meets your needs without overburdening your budget.

Hydroelectric plants use the flow of water for energy.\n\nThere are no harmful emissions involved, just clean, renewable energy.\n\nWith its abundant sunshine and wind, Texas is a prime location for renewable energy, making us a leader in the field.\n\n### What's the Deal with Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)?\n\nRECs are basically proof that renewable energy has been added to the grid. When you get a megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity from renewable sources, that's what a REC represents.\n\nChoosing a green plan often means you're buying RECs, ensuring that the electricity you use is matched by renewable energy on the grid.\n\n### Why Go Green?\n\nSwitching to green electricity helps protect our planet and could even help stabilize your energy bills. Renewable sources tend to stay more stable under market pressure, unlike their fossil fuel counterparts.\n\n### Who Should Go Green?\n\nGoing green is perfect for anyone looking to reduce their environmental impact. It's ideal for homeowners, eco-conscious individuals, and businesses pursuing sustainability goals.\n\nJust keep an eye on prices because some green plans cost more than other plans.\n\n### Getting the Most from Green Energy at Home\n\nTo maximize the benefits of your green energy plan, combine it with energy-efficient practices and technology.\n\nStart by switching to energy-efficient lighting and appliances and check out smart home technology, such as programmable thermostats and energy monitoring systems.\n\nWant to dive deeper into green electricity?\n\nCheck out our rundown on [Green Renewable Energy in Texas](https://comparepower.com/green-renewable-energy-companies-plans-rates/)\n\n## How to Choose the Best Electricity Company\n\nWant to find the best electricity company for your home? Shop based on your usage.\n\nHere's how ⤵️\n\n<WpBlock77727_CpVideoPopup />\n\n### Tips for Choosing the Best Company for You\n\nNow that you've seen the top green providers and learned how to shop based on your usage, here are some tips to help you make your decision:\n\n**Focus on your kWh needs:** Determine how much energy you use to choose a plan that fits just right, without paying extra. Just moved in and not sure about your usage? Try our [kWh calculator](https://comparepower.com/kwh-electricity-energy-usage-calculator/).\n\n**Compare rates and contract lengths:** Look through the plans to find one that meets your needs in terms of price and commitment.\n\n**Watch out for extra charges:** Keep an eye out for hidden fees like early termination or minimum usage charges listed in the plan details.\n\n**Read reviews:** Customer reviews can give you insight into what it's really like to be with a company, from satisfaction levels to service quality.\n\n**Consider customer service:** Make sure the provider is known for good customer support for those times you'll need help.\n\n## Go Green and Save\n\nChoosing a renewable energy plan from one of Texas's top providers?\n\nSmart move. You'll be doing your part for the planet and could even see your power bills go down.\n\nUse ComparePower to easily compare green options and the latest rates to find a plan that perfectly matches your household use and budget.\n\nSigning up is a breeze.

Texas, managing your electricity use is crucial, especially with our intense heat and lifestyle.\n\nHigh usage typically means consistently going over the state average of 1700-1800 kWh a month, driven by our hot summers, large homes, and reliance on technology.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, focus on energy efficiency, smart home technology, and finding the right electricity plan for your needs.\n\n### How Texas's Weather and Landscape Affect Your Electric Bill\n\nTexas's diverse climate means that electricity usage varies seasonally.\n\nSummer months often lead to higher consumption due to air conditioning, while winters require less heating.\n\nAdapting your energy usage to the seasons, such as using energy-efficient air conditioners in summer and improving insulation for winter, can help you manage costs and maintain comfort year-round.\n\n### Smart Moves for High Electricity Usage Homes\n\nTo manage high electricity use in Texas, consider switching to ENERGY STAR® appliances, installing programmable thermostats, and using LED lights.\n\nTweaking your thermostat settings and choosing energy-efficient window treatments can also make a noticeable difference in your energy consumption.\n\nImplementing these changes can help you optimize your energy usage and reduce costs.\n\nWant to read more?\n\nCheck out [Taming the Energy Vampires in Your

footprint.\n\nMany electricity providers offer renewable energy plans, so be sure to explore your options and consider making the switch.\n\n### High Usage FAQs\n\n**What does high electricity usage

We're here to be your guide, every step of the way.\n\n### Electricity Pricing 101\n\nElectricity prices in Texas are influenced by supply and demand in the market, the cost of fuels used to generate electricity, and regulations.\n\nUnderstanding these factors is like having a secret decoder ring for price changes. It empowers you to find more affordable options.\n\n### How Contract Length Affects Your Rates\n\nThe length of your electricity contract can significantly influence your rate. Longer contracts often boast lower prices, but they may limit your ability to switch plans if your needs change.\n\nOn the flip side, shorter contracts might come with slightly higher rates but offer the freedom to change plans if a more appealing deal appears on your radar.\n\n### Saving Big with Time-of-Use Plans\n\nIf you're willing to shift your electricity use, a time-of-use plan could be your budget's best friend.\n\nThese plans offer different prices based on when you use electricity.\n\nBy moving your high-consumption activities to off-peak hours when electricity costs less, you could see major savings on your bill.\n\n### Going Green Without Going Over Budget\n\nRenewable energy plans, sourced from green options like wind or solar, are becoming increasingly affordable.\n\nThey tend to offer more stable rates since they're less impacted by the ups and downs of fossil fuel markets. That's a win for your wallet and the planet.\n\n### Timing Your Rate Lock-In\n\nElectricity prices fluctuate throughout the year, with the best deals often popping up in spring and fall.\n\nKeeping an eye on these seasonal patterns can help you snag a lower rate when the timing is just right.\n\n### Dodging Hidden Fees\n\nBe a fee-fighting hero by watching out for sneaky charges hidden in electricity plans.\n\nThese can include connection or disconnection fees, monthly service charges, and even penalties for not using enough electricity.\n\nThose little extras can really sneak up on your bill.\n\n## Low Usage FAQs\n\n**How can I find the cheapest electricity rates in Texas.**\n\nThe key is to shop around, compare plans from different providers, consider your ideal contract length, and watch for special promotions. Staying informed about market conditions can also help you jump on the best rates.\n\n**How frequently do electricity rates change in Texas, and what's the best way to stay in the know.**\n\nTexas electricity prices can change with the seasons or when market conditions shift. A fixed-rate plan can provide some stability. For the latest prices, keep checking ComparePower—we'll make sure you're always in the loop.\n\n**Can I negotiate a lower electricity rate with providers.**\n\nNegotiating one-on-one with providers isn't common, but you can definitely choose a plan that fits your budget and your energy needs.\n\n**Are electricity rates lower at certain times of the year.**\n\nYou bet. Rates often drop in spring and fall when demand is lower. That's the perfect time to lock in a wallet-friendly plan.\n\n**Will choosing a longer contract get me a lower electricity rate.**\n\nIn many cases, yes. Longer contracts usually mean lower rates, but keep in mind that you might have less flexibility to switch plans if the market changes.\n\n**What's the best way to secure a low rate for the long haul.**\n\nFixed-rate plans are your friends when it comes to stable, low rates. Just be sure to review the contract carefully to dodge any surprise rate hikes.\n\n## Strategies to Secure the Best Company\n\nTo secure the best electricity deals, think like a savvy shopper.\n\nWhile the price per kWh is important, it's not the whole picture.\n\nTake into account the contract length, the provider's customer service track record, and feedback from other customers.\n\nWant the best electricity company for your home. Shop with your usage.\n\nHere's how ⤵️\n\n<WpBlock77727_CpVideoPopup />\n\n### Tips for Picking the Perfect Plan\n\nNow that you know how to shop based on your usage, here are some tips to help you choose the perfect plan for your needs and budget:\n\n- Use your kWh usage as your guide: Understanding your energy consumption helps you pick a plan that meets your needs without making you overspend. If you're new to your home and don't have past bills to reference, our handy [kWh calculator](https://comparepower.com/kwh-electricity-energy-usage-calculator/) can estimate your usage.\n\n- Play the field and compare: Check out the rates and contract terms of several plans to find the best fit for you.\n\n- Watch out for hidden fees: Read the plan details carefully to spot any sneaky charges, like early termination fees or minimum usage requirements.\n\n- Hunt for special deals: Keep your eyes peeled for limited-time promotions or discounts that could sweeten the deal.\n\n- Consider going green: If helping the planet is your jam, look into plans that offer renewable energy options.\n\n- Scope out company reviews: Reading feedback from real customers can give you valuable insight into a company's service and reliability.\n\n- Ensure solid customer support: Life happens, so it's important to choose a provider with responsive, helpful customer service.\n\n- Prioritize easy online management: Plans that come with user-friendly online account management tools put the power (pun intended) in your hands.\n\n## Take Control of Your Texas Electricity\n\nNavigating the Texas electricity market might seem daunting, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nBy understanding your options, comparing plans, and keeping an eye on rate trends, you can take the reins on your electricity costs and find the best deal for your needs.\n\nRemember, the right plan is the one that fits your budget, your household's needs, and your unique priorities.

You save money (who doesn't love that?), and you also do your part in reducing your carbon footprint.\n\nThat's good news for your wallet and our gorgeous Lone Star State.\n\n### Tips for Smart Electricity Management\n\nReady to become an electricity-saving pro?\n\nWe've got you covered with these simple tips and tricks. You'll be amazed at how small changes can add up to significant savings on your bill.\n\nWant to cut down on your power usage?\n\nStart with energy-efficient appliances – look for those ENERGY STAR labels.\n\nThey can use up to 50% less energy than the regular ones. And remember, small actions like switching off lights and unplugging gadgets can make a big difference.\n\nWant to read more?\n\nRead about [Tame the Energy Vampires in Your Home](https://comparepower.com/ways-to-control-energy-consuming-appliances/)\n\n### Decoding Your Electricity Bill\n\nYour bill in Texas usually has a base charge, a rate per kilowatt-hour, and sometimes extra fees.\n\nIf you're a low user, scout for plans with lower fixed charges and better rates for minor usage. This can help you save even more.\n\nConsider using our handy [kWh calculator](https://comparepower.com/kwh-electricity-energy-usage-calculator/) to estimate your monthly electricity usage and ensure you select the best plan for your needs.\n\nInput your appliance information and usage patterns, and the calculator will provide an estimated monthly kWh usage.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, you can more confidently compare plans and providers.\n\n### Green Energy: The Wise Choice for Low Users\n\nIn Texas, we're big on renewable energy.

In cooler times, let nature do the work and cut back on heating and cooling systems.\n\n## Low Usage FAQs\n\n**What's a low electricity user?**\n\nIf you're using less than 1,176 kWh per month, give yourself a pat on the back – you're a low user.\n\nThat means you're likely already seeing lower bills and doing your part to reduce your environmental impact. Keep up the great work.\n\n**How can I use even less electricity?**\n\nConsider switching to LED lighting – it's way more efficient than old-school bulbs.\n\nAlso, make it a habit to check for and turn off devices you're not using. Little changes like these can add up to significant savings over time.\n\n**Which electricity plans are best for low users?**\n\nLook for plans with little or no base charges and tiered rates that favor low usage.\n\nAlways compare these details when shopping for a provider to ensure you get the best deal for your needs.\n\n**Do renewable plans work for low users?**\n\nAbsolutely. In Texas, renewable plans are often a great deal for low users, plus they come with environmental perks and possible financial incentives.\n\nIt's a smart choice for both your wallet and the planet.\n\n**Can smart devices help me use less electricity?**\n\nYes, indeed. Devices like smart thermostats and energy monitors give you real-time data, helping you tweak your daily usage to save energy.\n\nThey're an excellent tool for staying on top of your consumption and finding new ways to save.\n\n**What should I check on my electricity bill?**\n\nMonitor your kWh usage, the rate per kWh, and any fixed charges.\n\nMake sure these match up with your records or meter readings.

All you have to do is follow their lead and you will find the best rates for your household today.\n\n \n\n### Compare Breeze Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nBreeze Energy is a Dallas-based retail energy company that offers plans exclusively powered by wind turbines. The company was founded by two entrepreneurs in 2012 with previous experience navigating the green energy space. Breeze Energy draws all of its wind energy from turbines based in Texas and serves all customers in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas area.\n\nBreeze Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Breeze Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon.

The month-to-month and Pay As You Go plans feature no cancellation fee, variable rates, and low monthly rates. These plans are advantageous for renters and corporate housing residents who may need to cancel plans on short notice.\n\nBreeze Energy also offers 12, 18, and 24-month plans for residents interested in fixed terms. Each of these plans requires paperless billing and features a cancellation fee ranging from $200 to $300 for early cancellation.

The company offers three options for commercial energy accounts. A fixed-rate plan works well for a business that needs consistency in their monthly billing.\n\nThe variable-rate plan allows a commercial client to take advantage of low prices or offset high prices by reducing consumption. A month-to-month plan from Breeze Energy allows a business owner to change plans or cancel without paying cancellation fees.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Breeze Energy **customer service & bill payment** \n\nCustomers of Breeze Energy are directed to the company’s customer service line at 855-391-9463 for service and billing questions.

The company does not handle utility service questions and points customers to their local utility provider to resolve transmission issues.\n\n \n\n### **Breeze Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Breeze Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Breeze Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/dallas/business-reviews/electric-companies/breeze-energy-in-dallas-tx-90515956/reviews-and-complaints).\n- Read customer complaints about [Breeze Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=RESQL01DB1245580400001&TXT_BEGIN=10/1/2017&TXT_END=3/31/2018)\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Brilliant Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/electric-companies/brilliant-energy-llc-in-houston-tx-90015163).\n- Read customer complaints about [Brilliant Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=ELSQL01DB1245429900001&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018).\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

    "_mdxContent": "\n## Budget Power in Texas\n\nSpotted Budget Power on Power to Choose?\n\nThey're making waves as a smaller provider with their \"credit-friendly solutions\" and \"transparent pricing\" pitch.\n\nWhile Budget Power plans aren't currently listed on Compare Power, we can still help you dodge high rates by comparing other providers in your area.\n\n<WpBlock94368_TrustCpDropdown />\n\n## Company Overview\n\nBudget Power's team has been in the Texas electricity game since deregulation kicked off over 20 years ago. They've powered up more than 500,000 Texas homes and businesses in that time, racking up customer service awards along the way.\n\n**Size:** They're running lean and mean, competing against the big players by keeping things local and responsive.\n\n**Core Services:**\n\n- **Home Electricity:** Straightforward plans without the fee circus.\n\n- **Business Power:** Custom solutions that work for your bottom line.\n\n## Service Areas and Availability\n\nYou'll find Budget Power across Texas's deregulated zones:\n\n- **[Oncor Electric Delivery](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/)** (North, Central, and West Texas)\n\n- **[AEP Texas](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/aep/)** (Coverage across North and Central Texas)\n\n- **[CenterPoint Energy](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/)** (Houston metropolitan area)\n\n- **[Texas-New Mexico Power](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/texas-new-mexico-power/)** (Select regions of North and West Texas)\n\n- **[Lubbock Power & Light](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/lubbock-power-light/)**\n\n## Customer Reviews\n\nLet's look at what people are saying about Budget Power on Google Reviews and social media:\n\n**Google Reviews Snapshot:** Two customers who reviewed the company shared very different experiences. One 5-star review praised competitive rates and friendly customer service, while another customer reported long hold times, inconsistent information, and frustrating experiences with support staff.\n\n**From Reddit Discussions:** Reddit threads paint a mixed picture too. Some folks appreciated their straightforward billing and credit-friendly options, while others mentioned challenges reaching support outside business hours.\n\nRemember – individual experiences vary widely with any electricity provider. That's exactly why we recommend comparing actual rates and plan details before signing up. Look at the total cost based on your usage patterns, not just advertised rates or individual reviews.\n\n## Comparing Budget Power Rates\n\nBudget Power talks a big game about transparent pricing and flexible terms.\n\nBut here's the deal – Texas electricity rates are as unpredictable as our weather. Many plans use fancy tricks like tiered pricing or bill credits to advertise rates that only work if you use a specific amount of power.\n\n**Why You Should Care:**\n\n- Using more or less power than their \"sweet spot\"? Your bill might give you a heart attack.\n\n- Those sneaky base charges can turn a \"great deal\" into a budget buster\n\n**<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" useCityAsFilter=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"cent\" table-max-width=\"800px\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" textAfterTable=\"\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" pricingBasedOn=\"1000\" headingWrapperTag=\"h2\" />**\n\n## Finding Your Best Rate\n\nComparing electricity plans doesn't have to mean hours spent analyzing bills and rates.\n\n[**Live Link™**](https://comparepower.com/live-link/) simplifies this process by:\n\n- Securely accessing your actual usage data from your current provider\n\n- Analyzing your consumption patterns, including seasonal changes\n\n- Showing you personalized plan recommendations based on your specific usage\n\n- Revealing [true costs](https://comparepower.com/true-cost-electricity/) beyond advertised rates\n\n- Enabling online enrollment in minutes\n\n[**Try Live Link™ Now** →](https://comparepower.com/live-link/)\n\n## Contact Information\n\nNeed to reach Budget Power? Here's how:\n\n**Website:** [budgetpowertx.com](http://budgetpowertx.com/)\n\n**Phone:** [888-699-0747](tel:888-699-0747)\n\n**Email:** [**info@budgetpowertx.com**](mailto:info@budgetpowertx.com)\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nBudget Power's playing the small-but-mighty card in Texas, focusing on folks who might get the cold shoulder from bigger providers. Some customers love their straight-talk billing and helpful service, while others wish they could get help after hours.\n\nBefore you commit, compare their rates with other providers on Compare Power. Use your actual usage data to see what you'll really pay – because surprises are great for birthdays, not electric bills.\n\nWant a real person to walk you through your options?

Pump 10 gallons, and pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complex and every plan differs?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Help me Choose\" classname=\"in_post_guideme\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for help choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n## Champion Energy Plans\n\nSwitch to Champion Energy for competitive electricity rates, easy-to-read electric bills, and exceptional 24/7 customer service based in Texas.\n\nChampion Energy offers the following electricity plans:\n\n**Fixed Rate - 12 Months**  \nAs Champion Energy’s most popular plan, the 12-month fixed-rate plan offers price security for an entire year.\n\n**Time of Use with Free Weekends - 12 Months**  \nSign up for a Champion time-of-use plan with free weekend electricity.

A hybrid plan is great for businesses that need budget certainty and predictability but can tolerate moderate fluctuations and overages.\n\n**Layered Purchased Plan**  \nA layered plan is an indexed plan that allows a fixed price for a percentage of energy usage when market conditions are favorable. It is best suited for businesses that want to time purchases with the market and can tolerate moderate budget fluctuations.\n\n**Indexed Rate Plan**  \nFor businesses with higher risk tolerance, the indexed rate plan offers the most flexibility with the ability to switch to another plan when market conditions change.

ComparePower is an independent marketplace offering free electricity pricing comparisons for consumers.\n\nTime to read: about 5 min\n\n**Sections in this guide:** Click on a section below to skip directly to it.\n\n1. **[Circular Energy electric choice in Texas](#ElectricChoice)**\n2. **[Compare Circular Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans](#CompareRates)**\n3. **[How to choose the best energy plan in Texas (know your usage!)](#HowTo)**\n4. **[Circular Energy residential energy plans](#Residential)**\n5. **[Circular Energy business energy plans](#Business)**\n6. **[Circular Energy customer service & bill payment](#CustomerService)**\n7. **[Circular Energy reviews](#Reviews)**\n8. **[Texas energy companies](#Companies)**\n9. **[Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas](#Cities)**\n10. **[Shop electricity rates by Texas zip codes](#ZipCodes)**\n11. **[Electricity rates by utility service areas in Texas](#Utilities)**\n\n \n\n### **Circular Energy electric choice in Texas**\n\nThe deregulation of the Texas energy industry in 2002 has given customers the power to choose. Customers in Texas can now select from dozens of providers and hundreds of energy plans.\n\nComparePower helps enhance your power as a consumer and ensures that residents and businesses truly get the best rates and plans for their energy needs. It is a tool that will take care of all the hard work you would normally do yourself. Research, calling companies, and calculating usage are all done for you at the click of a button.\n\nDon’t rush into a plan that sounds really good without comparing rates with ComparePower first.\n\nComparePower allows you to compare the rates of Texas energy providers and discloses hidden fees or other sale gimmicks, ensuring that you get the best possible rate for your home or business.\n\n \n\n### Compare Circular Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nCircular Energy is an Austin-based retail energy provider that serves residential and commercial customers. The company was founded in 2009.\n\nCircular Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Circular Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Circular Energy residential plans\n\nCircular Energy offers fixed-rate residential plans for Texas customers. These plans range from 12 months to 24 months and protect customers from energy market fluctuations.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n \n\n### Circular Energy **business plans**\n\nCircular Energy works with commercial clients in Texas to develop electricity plans. Prospective business clients can contact Circular Energy for customized monthly rates based on usage and business size.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Circular Energy **customer service & bill payment**\n\nCustomers of Circular Energy can reach live support staff by phone at 1-844-776-7693. This phone line is available Monday through Friday and also acts as the phone line for bill payments. Customers can also email customerservice@circularenergy.com to ask billing or account questions.\n\nIn addition to payments by phone, Circular Energy allows payments to be made by bank draft or card through its online account system.\n\n \n\n### **Circular Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Circular Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias including the Better Business Bureau.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Circular Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/central-texas/business-reviews/solar-energy-equipment-dealers/circular-energy-lp-in-austin-tx-90103544).\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

No longer could companies hold monopolies over certain areas of the state. You have the power to choose from hundreds of competitors serving your community.\n\nComparePower was founded in 2009 to help customers navigate through the deregulated marketplace in Texas. This no-cost comparison tool does all the hard work that it takes to make an informed decision about the right energy plan for your household. From research to calculations, they will take care of it so you can focus on other things.\n\nYou can compare the plans and rates on a level playing field because ComparePower calculates taxes and all fees into energy provider quotes.\n\n \n\n[](#_ftnref1)\n\n### Compare Clearview Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nClearview Energy is a Dallas-based retail electricity provider that serves residential and commercial customers. Clearview Energy was incorporated in Texas in 2006 and serves customers in Illinois and 11 states in the Northeast.\n\nClearview Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Clearview Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Clearview Energy residential plans\n\nClearview Energy serves residential customers in Texas with a few standard plans. The company's fixed-rate plan is available for a one-year contract. Clearview Energy also offers a renewable energy plan that uses wind or solar energy rather than coal-powered energy.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n \n\n### Clearview Energy **business plans**\n\nBusinesses in Clearview Energy's service area receive customized quotes by calling or emailing the company's customer service team. Quoted rates are based on monthly usage rates, business sizes, and budgets.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Clearview Energy **customer service & bill payment**\n\n \n\nClearview Energy customers can call 1-800-746-4702 to ask account questions or pay their bills. Customers can also email customerservice@clearviewenergy.com with questions or concerns.\n\nCustomers can use the following methods to pay their bills:\n\n- **Pay online**: Clearview Energy allows credit or debit card payments through its online account management system.\n- **Pay in person:** Customers can pay their bills at ACE Cash Express or MoneyGram locations.\n\n \n\n### **Clearview Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Clearview Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Clearview Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/dallas/business-reviews/energy-service-companies/clearview-energy-in-dallas-tx-90338662).\n- Read customer complaints about [Clearview Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=ELSQL01DB1245404300003&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018).\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

I’ve been with them for 2 years and I have no complaints. One of the things I admire most is the usage report. I can quickly identify how much energy I’ve used and if I need to dial it back a bit. If I ever have questions, they are answered and explained thoroughly. I have recommended several of my friends as well so if you’re looking for a provider, Constellation is the way to go!\" - [Dessiriah B.](https://g.co/kgs/YN1Wndt)\n\n\"So far, so good! We have great service. Don't know if I am happy with the cost - waiting for summer to determine that factor.\" - [Philanthy G.](https://g.co/kgs/QvRBRKp)\n\n\"Constellation is a great company to use for your electricity needs! They provide an excellent AC Service as well. When my A/C made a noise, they sent the contractor service tech out to assist. He diagnosed my a/c and replaced a small part at no charge to me. That was one of the many perks that Constellation provided. Please give them a try, you will not regret it!\" - [Sarah L.](https://g.co/kgs/jCZ1gZZ)\n\n### Negative Experiences\n\n\"I used them last year (2023) and everything was fine…until I took a trip for 6 weeks out of the country during the summer and for whatever reason my auto pay credit card stopped working (only for their company). So they turned off my electricity and things in the freezer got beyond gross… And yes it’s a slap in the face when they want you to then sign a new contract with higher rates…as if they had done this on purpose. I left them asap.\" - [Amy B.](https://g.co/kgs/Fe6DemQ)\n\n\"Constellation energy is VERY disorganized. You cannot complete enrollment online, and they insist on having a scanned copy of your ID, which I provided. They were supposed to call me back with confirmation of service, but they never did... Total bait and switch, and they are clueless!\" - [Hope A.](https://g.co/kgs/AxiiwZS)\n\n\"The worst service ever bad customer service. We are left without power for more than two days because contract was terminated without notice over return payment even when the payment was made. Just pray you don’t have issues with these people, they will treat you like trash. They wanted to force me to sign a new contract with higher prices …….All scams and lies no empathy.\" - [Mojisola A.](https://g.co/kgs/QRFG5NC)\n\n## Constellation Energy: Customizable Plans Tailored to You\n\nWhat sets Constellation Energy apart is their commitment to offering a wide variety of customizable plans designed to fit your unique energy needs and lifestyle.\n\nWhether you're a homeowner looking for a plan that fits your budget or a business owner seeking a more tailored energy solution, Constellation has you covered with their flexible options and competitive rates.\n\nJust remember not to pick a provider blindly.

This means that instead of having to take whatever price your provider offers, you have the power to choose. There are hundreds of companies competing with each other and driving prices down. There has never been a better time to shop for electricity.\n\nWith all of these choices, how can you decide on the right one for your household? ComparePower was established in 2009 as a way to assist consumers in choosing the right plan. They do all of the heavy lifting of research and calculations to ensure that you are getting what you need at the best price.\n\nComparePower includes all fees allowing you to compare plans apples to apples.\n\n \n\n### Compare CPL Retail Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nCPL Retail Energy was established in 2001 to serve residential and commercial energy customers. This Houston-based retail energy provider mainly serves customers in southern Texas.\n\nCPL Retail Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n \n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a CPL Retail Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### CPL Retail Energy residential plans\n\nEach every household is different. CPL Retail Energy offers plans that cater to different household needs. These plans include:\n\n- **Free Electricity Plan:** This plan features a slightly higher monthly rate but includes free days to offset costs.\n- **Fixed Rate Plan 12-Month**: This standard plan uses a fixed rate to maintain budget stability for one year.\n- **Month-to-Month Plan:** Residential customers who want to shop around, try out CPL Retail Energy, or are moving in the future can use this plan.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n \n\n### [](#_ftnref1)CPL Retail Energy **business plans**\n\nCPL Retail Energy does not maintain a published list of sample rates or plans for commercial customers. Business owners are asked to contact CPL Retail Energy for customized quotes.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### CPL Retail Energy **customer service & bill payment**\n\nCPL Retail Energy provides customer service by phone at 1-866-322-5563. The customer support team can also be reached at WTUCPLRetailEnergy@directenergy.com.\n\nCPL Retail Energy accepts bill payments by phone at 1-844-292-6128. Customers can also pay their bills or seek assistance through online accounts maintained by the company.\n\n \n\n### **CPL Retail Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for CPL Retail Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commission of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [CPL Retail Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/electric-companies/direct-energy-lp-in-houston-tx-16000037/reviews-and-complaints).\n- Read customer complaints about [CPL Retail Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=ELSQL01DB1245229100022&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018).\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

However, some users report challenges with customer service, particularly when it comes to resolving billing issues.\n\nConstellation receives mixed reviews. Many praise their competitive initial rates and plan variety. However, some customers warn about unexpected rate hikes after introductory periods and hidden fees on bills.\n\nA few users mentioned challenges with customer service, including long wait times, and difficulties canceling contracts without incurring hefty fees.\n\nThe main takeaway? Do your research. Don't just pick the cheapest plan and hope for the best. What works for one person might not be the best fit for you.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates.

This opened the energy provider floodgates and the market was soon overflowing with companies vying for your business. This means that prices have been driven lower and you finally have the power to choose.\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility. That is why ComparePower is here to help you pick the right energy plan for your household. No longer do you have to waste hours doing research, calculations, and filling out documents.\n\nNow you can see all your possible rates and plans side by sides. ComparePower discloses hidden fees that allow you to see the true cost of the energy plan you choose. ComparePowe helps you make the right choice to power your home.\n\n \n\n### Compare Eligo Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nEligo Energy is an Illinois-based retail energy provider that serves customers in Texas and the northeastern United States. The company was founded in 2012 and began operation in Texas in 2017.\n\nEligo Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting an Eligo Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Eligo Energy residential plans\n\nEligo Energy works with each residential customer to develop a custom quote. This quote is based on historical usage of the property, location, and plan type. Prospective customers can use the company's online form to request additional information on residential energy plans.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage. Moving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower.

Prospective clients are asked to contact the company through an online form to request customized quotes.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Eligo Energy **customer service & bill payment**\n\nEligo Energy customers can contact service representatives at 1-888-744-8125. Customers can also ask questions or express concerns by emailing customerservice@eligoenergy.com.\n\nCustomers have two options when paying their bills: contact the customer service line or set up payments using their Eligo Energy online accounts.\n\n \n\n### **Eligo Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Eligo Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias including the Better Business Bureau (BBB).\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Eligo Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/chicago/business-reviews/energy-service-company/eligo-energy-llc-in-chicago-il-88597878).\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

Companies are now competing for your business and adjusting their rates to be competitive. Before you decide to sign up for an Entrust Energy plan, you should examine your options and determine what works best for you.\n\nComparePower works to do just that as a no-cost consumer service that has been in operation since 2009. You are now able to compare plans without having to worry about hidden fees that were not disclosed by sales representatives. ComparePower helps you find the best plan through a fast and simple comparison process.\n\nWhile you would normally spend hours filling in spreadsheets and keeping track of calculations, ComparePower does the hard work for you. All you have to do is enter your zip code and ComparePower will guide you to the best electricity rates for your household.\n\n \n\n### Compare Entrust Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nEntrust Energy is a Houston-based retail energy provider that serves customers throughout Texas. The company also serves customers in six additional states including Illinois, Ohio, and New York. Entrust Energy has been helping Texas consumers in the Oncor, Texas CNP, Texas-New Mexico Power, and AEP Texas service areas since 2010.\n\nEntrust has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting an Entrust Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Entrust Energy residential plans\n\nResidential electrical service from Entrust Energy is available in different contract lengths. Customers can select one, one and a half, two, and three-year contracts based on their energy needs. Entrust Energy is a member of the Retail Energy Supply Association, an organization that focuses on affordable energy plans for the customers of its member companies.\n\nThe company’s Texas Refresh electricity plan helps customers reduce their impact on the environment. This plan draws all of its electricity from renewable energy sources.\n\nEntrust Energy offers numerous discounts and incentive programs to its customers. The Military and Veteran Discount Program offers $5 in bill credits per month for military personnel and veterans. This program applies to all five branches of the military and approved customers receive this credit as long as they are Entrust Energy account holders.\n\nThe Refer-a-Friend program provides a $50 credit for each new customer referred by an account holder. The referring account holder must be a customer for at least 45 days and contact Entrust Energy with the new customer’s information to receive the credit.\n\nEntrust Energy also provides deposit waivers for those who may have difficulty paying upfront costs. The company may waive deposits for customers 65 years or older, victims of domestic abuse, or low-income customers who can provide financial hardship.\n\n \n\n### Entrust Energy **commercial plans**\n\nEntrust Energy provides electricity service to commercial customers in Texas. The company’s customer service team works with each business to determine their energy consumption needs. Entrust Energy asks commercial clients to call or email the company or use the company’s online form for service. The company’s website does not provide additional information about commercial energy service.\n\nTo find the best electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Entrust Energy **customer service**\n\nThere are several customer service options for Entrust Energy account holders in need of assistance. The company’s customer service line at 800-871-8100 is the quickest method for answering billing questions. Entrust Energy encourages customers to contact their utility provider by phone to resolve service questions because the company does not handle service calls. Customer service representatives are available from 8:00 am to 7:00 pm Central from Monday to Friday and 10:00 am to 2:00 pm Central on Saturday.\n\nEntrust Energy offers other methods for customers who may not need immediate assistance. The company maintains Twitter and Facebook accounts that can be alternative methods for low-priority questions. Customers can use the company’s customer care email to answer complex questions that may be tough to resolve by phone.\n\n \n\n### **Entrust Energy payment** \n\nEntrust Energy offers four methods for customers to pay their bills. The most common method of payment is the company’s online account management system. A customer can pay their bill using a credit card or bank account after setting up an online account with Entrust Energy.\n\nThe company’s customer service line allows account holders to pay their bills. This phone number allows a customer to select an automated system or speak with a customer service representative. Customers can also set up recurring payments on future bills to save time and ensure on-time payment.\n\nEntrust Energy also allows customers to pay their bills by mail or in person. The in-person payment option is available at Walmart, Fiesta, and H-E-B locations in Entrust’s service areas.\n\nCustomers can participate in the company’s free Paperless Billing program. The default billing option is a traditional paper bill even if a customer pays through the website or via recurring payments.\n\n \n\n### **Entrust Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Entrust Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Entrust Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/electric-companies/entrust-energy-in-houston-tx-90027018).\n- Read customer complaints about [Entrust Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=RESQL01DB1245544000001&TXT_BEGIN=10/1/2017&TXT_END=3/31/2018)\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

Prices are now being driven down as energy retailers compete and vie for your business. No longer are you stuck with the price set by a single provider. You have the power to choose.\n\nShopping for a new energy plan in Texas? ComparePower does all of the time-consuming work for you, like research and calculations, so that you don’t have to waste your day away sorting through power company websites.\n\nComparePower quickly and easily determines the best rate for your specific household energy usage and discloses all fees so you can find the best energy plan.\n\n \n\n### Compare Express Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nExpress Energy is a retail energy provider based in Irving, Texas. This company has served residential customers in Texas since 2017.\n\nExpress Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n \n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting an Express Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Express Energy residential plans\n\nExpress Energy offers one-year and two-year plans to residential energy customers in Texas. These plans feature fixed rates during the duration of contracts.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower.

You need to compare total costs across plans based on your kWh consumption.\n\nAdvertised \"prices per kWh\" can be misleading. They assume an exact usage amount like 1000 or 2000 kWh. In reality, your usage fluctuates.\n\nTo determine the true price per kWh, you have to calculate the total monthly bill for your expected usage and divide by your kWh.\n\nThis math can get complicated with complex rate structures. That's why using a comparison tool that does the work for you is so valuable.\n\nSimply enter your actual past usage. The tool will instantly calculate each plan's total monthly cost based on your consumption. This allows you to accurately compare \"apples to apples\" and find the cheapest option.\n\nKnowing your usage makes shopping for electricity easy! Avoid overpaying by using your kWh history to compare costs.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Let's Go\" classname=\"in_post_guideme\" prependText=\"Find your best energy plan and electricity rate in minutes.\" />\n\n## First Choice Power Electricity Plans\n\nFirst Choice Power offers a variety of electricity plan types to meet different needs:\n\n- **Fixed Rate** - Lock in a steady price for 6, 12, or 24 months\n\n- **Prepaid** - Pay-as-you-go flexibility and no long contracts\n\n- **Monthly** - No long-term contract or cancellation fees\n\n- **Time of Use** \\- Lower rates for nights and weekends\n\n- **Green Energy** - Plans with renewable wind and solar\n\nFirst Choice Power also offers no-deposit plan options for those who don't want to put money down upfront.\n\nWhen searching plans, be sure to compare costs based on your estimated monthly usage.

Do your homework and don't just chase the lowest advertised rate.\n\n## What No One's Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

What works for one person might not be the best fit for you.\n\nFor both Gexa and Constellation, keep an eye on how rates might change over time and carefully review all contract terms before signing up.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

    "_mdxContent": "\nWhether new to Texas, a long-time resident, or a business owner, this guide provides useful information on G-Power and allows you to compare rates from other Texas energy companies so that you can find your best solution to power your home or business.\n\nAny product or company names, marks or logos shown on this page are the property of their respective owners. ComparePower is an independent marketplace offering free electricity pricing comparisons for consumers.\n\nTime to read: about 5 min\n\n**Sections in this guide:** Click on a section below to skip directly to it.\n\n1. **[G-Power electric choice in Texas](#ElectricChoice)**\n2. **[Compare G-Power rates with competing Texas energy plans](#CompareRates)**\n3. **[How to choose the best energy plan in Texas (know your usage!)](#HowTo)**\n4. **[G-Power residential energy plans](#Residential)**\n5. **[G-Power business energy plans](#Business)**\n6. **[G-Power customer service & bill payment](#CustomerService)**\n7. **[G-Power reviews](#Reviews)**\n8. **[Texas energy companies](#Companies)**\n9. **[Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas](#Cities)**\n10. **[Shop electricity rates by Texas zip codes](#ZipCodes)**\n11. **[Electricity rates by utility service areas in Texas](#Utilities)**\n\n \n\n### **G-Power Energy electric choice in Texas**\n\nEnergy in Texas was deregulated by the state legislature in 2002. There are hundreds of energy companies competing for new customers. Before signing up for a G-Power plan, you should shop and compare rates from other providers to ensure you are in fact getting the lowest possible rate available for your specific situation.\n\nComparePower is a no-cost consumer service established in 2009 to help Texans searching for the most affordable energy plans. A simple interface allows customers to see plans side by side rather than spending hours searching for information about energy companies.\n\nComparePower discloses all fees and charges for plans, helping you choose the best provider with the lowest rate. Quotes found on ComparePower are reliable because they include charges often left out of advertised rates.\n\n \n\n### Compare G-Power Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nG-Power is a retail energy provider that began operations in 2017. This McAllen-based company serves residential and commercial customers throughout Texas.\n\nG-Power has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a G-Power plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### G-Power Energy residential plans\n\nG-Power's standard residential plan features a fixed rate over 12 months. This plan protects account holders from spikes in the energy market. Another option for homeowners is a charity plan that donates portions of each bill to a select group of charities.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n \n\n### G-Power **Energy business plans**\n\nG-Power does not publish commercial business plans, rates, or sample bills on its website. Prospective business clients can contact G-Power to request quotes based on their budgets and usage rates.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### G-Power **Energy customer service & bill payment**\n\nCustomers who need to speak with G-Power's service team or pay their bills can call 1-800-378-3339. G-Power also accepts questions, comments, and concerns by email at support@getGpower.com.\n\nG-Power account holders can use the company's online account management system to pay their bills or set up recurring payments. The provider also accepts mailed payments at Dept. 3667, P.O. Box 123667, Dallas, TX 75312-3667.\n\n \n\n### **G-Power Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for G-Power?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas. There were no reviews or complaints against G-Power on either site as of May 2018.\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

Take your time comparing plans carefully before you commit.\n\nThose attractive intro rates aren't the whole story - compare all your options so you get the best plan for your home.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

ComparePower is an independent marketplace offering free electricity pricing comparisons for consumers.\n\nTime to read: about 5 min\n\n**Sections in this guide:** Click on a section below to skip directly to it.\n\n1. **[Griddy Energy electric choice in Texas](#ElectricChoice)**\n2. **[Compare Griddy Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans](#CompareRates)**\n3. **[How to choose the best energy plan in Texas (know your usage!)](#HowTo)**\n4. **[Griddy Energy residential energy plans](#Residential)**\n5. **[Griddy Energy business energy plans](#Business)**\n6. **[Griddy Energy customer service & bill payment](#CustomerService)**\n7. **[Griddy Energy reviews](#Reviews)**\n8. **[Texas energy companies](#Companies)**\n9. **[Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas](#Cities)**\n10. **[Shop electricity rates by Texas zip codes](#ZipCodes)**\n11. **[Electricity rates by utility service areas in Texas](#Utilities)**\n\n \n\n### **Griddy Energy electric choice in Texas**\n\nThe power to choose electricity plans came to residents of Texas in 2002. The state legislature passed laws that deregulated the energy industry and resulted in hundreds of providers entering the market. Energy prices became competitive to attract consumers. There has never been a better time to choose a new provider.\n\nComparePower, established in 2009, is a helpful tool that allows you to compare the rates and plans that companies are offering in your area. Normally this would take you hours of work, but ComparePower does the necessary research in minutes to help you save money. \n\nThe quoted rates on ComparePower include base rates, fees, and taxes to help customers see the true costs of energy. This commitment to transparency helps users plan their budgets and avoid billing gimmicks.\n\n \n\n### Compare Griddy Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nGriddy Energy is a California-based energy provider that serves the state of Texas. This retail provider was certified by the Public Utilities Commission of Texas in 2017. Griddy sells wholesale electricity directly to customers in deregulated power markets for a monthly fixed fee.\n\nGriddy offers a prepaid variable rate plan. For a $9.99 monthly fee, you can get access to wholesale electricity pricing.\n\nPlaying the wholesale market is a huge gamble as the wholesale price of electricity fluctuates wildly based on a number of factors, including weather, maintenance issues and the time of day, leaving consumers vulnerable when prices skyrocket during peak conditions.\n\nThe bottom line is when you need electricity the most, you pay the highest price. Most people prefer predictability and stability in their energy.  The best way to have a predictable energy bill is to lock in a fixed-rate and not gamble by guessing what the wholesale price of electricity will be in the future.\n\nComparePower lets you find and compare low fixed-rate plans from multiple Texas electricity providers, ensuring you are getting the best rate possible for the term of your contract.\n\nThe rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Griddy Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Griddy Energy residential plans\n\nGriddy Energy offers a variable-rate energy plan to residential customers. This plan uses daily energy prices to determine rates for each customer. A variable-rate plan can mean savings during troughs in the energy market, though customers can also pay higher bills when market prices increase over time.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n \n\n### Griddy Energy **business plans**\n\nCustomer advisors with Griddy Energy work with commercial customers to develop energy plans. These consultations allow Griddy Energy to develop rates and contract terms based on a company's needs.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Griddy Energy **customer service & bill payment**\n\nGriddy Energy customers can call 800-993-6207 Monday through Friday to speak to representatives. The customer support team also answers questions emailed to support@gogriddy.com.\n\nCustomers do not receive bills each month for their Griddy Energy accounts. This company uses a prepaid model that allows customers to fill their account balances based on ongoing energy consumption.\n\n \n\n### **Griddy Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Griddy Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas. Neither site had reviews or complaints about Griddy Energy as of May 2018.\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

This free comparison marketplace was started in 2009 to help consumers view plans on an \"apples to apples\" basis. Rather than spending hours to research plans on your own, ComparePower presents rates from many electricity providers in your area so you can compare all rates at a glance.\n\nComparePower includes fees, charges, and other costs in its prices to ensure total transparency.  Search for your best rate and instantly sign up for a plan without leaving ComparePower.\n\n \n\n### Compare Hello Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nHello Energy is a Houston-based subsidiary of Champion Energy Services. This retail energy provider serves residential customers throughout the state of Texas.\n\nHello Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Hello Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage.

One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about LifeEnergy on the [Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/energy-service-company/lifeenergy-llc-in-houston-tx-90048560).\n- Read customer complaints about LifeEnergy on the [Public Utility Commission of Texas website](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=RESQL01DB1245788400001&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018).\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

The state's energy market added hundreds of new companies competing for the business of residents. This development drove down prices and gave consumers the power to choose.\n\nChoosing an energy plan can be hard without some help from an outside source. ComparePower was established in 2009 as a free comparison service for Texas energy plans. The tools on ComparePower do all the hard work that would normally take you hours of research instantly.\n\nComparePower shows all fees by comparing plans side by side, helping you choose the best retail provider with the lowest rate without wasting hours of your time calling different companies or sorting through countless websites.\n\n \n\n### Compare My Quest Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nMy Quest Energy is a San Antonio-based energy provider that serves the state of Texas. The Public Utility Commission of Texas certified My Quest Energy in 2015.\n\nMy Quest Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a My Quest Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### My Quest Energy residential plans\n\nMy Quest Energy offers fixed-rates plans to homeowners and other residential customers. These plans are available in one-year and two-year contracts with the two-year contract offsetting a higher initial rate with a longer period of rate stability.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n \n\n### My Quest Energy **business plans**\n\nBusinesses shopping for commercial energy plans can request customized quotes from My Quest Energy. These quotes are calculated using historical property usage and company size.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### My Quest Energy **customer service & bill payment**\n\n \n\nMy Quest Energy offers live phone support Monday through Friday at 1-817-856-2530.

This trend lowered prices and gave consumers the power to choose their ideal plans.\n\nComparePower is a free service founded in 2009 to help Texans search for their best energy plan.\n\nEnergy plans from multiple providers are shown in a simple way so that total costs are easily understood. That makes comparing your options simple and easy.\n\nComparePower shows all fees by comparing plans side by side, helping you choose the best retail provider with the lowest rate without wasting hours of your time calling different companies or sorting through countless websites.\n\n \n\n### Compare OnPAC Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nOnPAC Energy is a Dallas-based energy provider that offers plans to residential and business clients. The company was certified by the Public Utility Commission of Texas in 2003.\n\nOnPAC Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting an OnPAC Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### OnPAC Energy residential plans\n\nResidential customers with OnPAC Energy choose between fixed-rate and variable-rate plans. A fixed-rate plan allows a customer to pay the same rate each month without worrying about market fluctuations. A variable-rate plan uses the market energy rate to determine monthly bills, allowing customers to ride lows in market prices to offset spikes.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower.

These prices are based on a company's energy usage, size, and budget.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### OnPAC Energy **customer service & bill payment**\n\nOnPAC Energy serves customers by phone at 1-866-696-6722.

ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about OnPAC [Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/dallas/business-reviews/electric-companies/onpac-energy-in-dallas-tx-90040386).\n- Read customer complaints about OnPAC [Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=ELSQL01DB1245297600003&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018)\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

In a deregulated market, you are able to shop around for energy plans that fit your budget. Energy companies in your area have responded by offering lowered rates and other incentives. Before selecting an Our Energy plan, you should look at all available plans in your area.\n\nComparePower simplifies this search process by allowing side-by-side comparisons of energy plans. This no-cost service has been operating since 2009. ComparePower helps you search for the right plan for your budget and energy needs.\n\nYou can save valuable time by allowing ComparePower to gather electricity plan information on your behalf. comparepower.compiles quotes and sign-up information that would otherwise require hours of tedious research. In a few minutes, you can access the full spectrum of rates available for your home.\n\n \n\n### Compare Our Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nOur Energy is a Houston-based retail electricity provider that opened its doors in 2009. This provider offers residential and commercial energy plans to customers throughout Texas. Our Energy also provides customized service to Texas nonprofits through its Our Community program.\n\nOur Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting an Our Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Our Energy residential plans\n\nThe typical residential plan from Our Energy is a 12-month fixed-rate plan. This plan features a kilowatt hour rate based on 11,000-kilowatt hours of monthly use. Our Energy offers no monthly fee with its plans. The company charges an early termination fee of $200 if a customer breaks contract prior to the expiration date.\n\nOur Energy offers bill credits to existing customers who refer their friends, family, and colleagues to the company. These credits are applied to future bills after referred applicants have completed registration. Our Energy also uses contests and raffles to engage customers.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n \n\n### Our Energy **commercial plans**\n\nOur Energy does not provide a sample commercial energy account on its website. The company asks commercial clients and applicants to submit their information for customized service. A business owner or operator can submit their contact information, type of business, and electricity usage to receive a free customized quote.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Our Energy **customer service & bill payment** \n\nCustomers of Our Energy can pay their bills, review energy usage, and read knowledge documents through their online accounts. Each bill available through an online account details charges, historical usage, and contract details. To establish an account, a customer needs an account number, zip code, email, and login information. The company’s Quick Pay option allows a user to input account number, zip code, and phone to expedite bill payments.\n\nOur Energy highlights their same-day move capabilities on its website. The company notes that they can handle expedited switches as well as account transfers outside of the usual meter reading cycle.\n\nOur Energy’s customer care center is available by phone or email Monday through Friday. Customers can also use dedicated email addresses for customer service, billing, and complaints to submit their requests. The company does not handle utility requests but maintains contact information for local utility providers in case of service issues. Our Energy also engages with customers via Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+.\n\n \n\n### **Our Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Our Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers.

Customers now have the power to choose the provider that works best for their household.\n\nThe decision to switch energy providers can be overwhelming due to deregulation. ComparePower was established in 2009 as a way to help consumers. This no-cost comparison service allows consumers to bypass hours of research as they look for new energy providers. \n\nComparePower believes that customers should be able to make informed decisions that are beneficial to their households. This belief guides the company's inclusion of taxes and fees that may not typically be included in advertised quotes. \n\n### Compare Penstar Power rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nPenstar Power is a Dallas-based retail energy provider that serves homeowners and other residential customers. This company was certified by the Public Utility Commission of Texas in 2004.\n\nPenstar Power has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Penstar Power plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon.

ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Penstar Power on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website.](https://www.bbb.org/dallas/business-reviews/electric-companies/penstar-power-in-dallas-tx-90238321)\n- Read customer complaints about [Penstar Power on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=ELSQL01DB1245313600001&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018)\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

Companies are now competing for your business with low introductory rates. Before you decide to sign up for a Pioneer Energy plan, you should research your options and determine if there is a lower rate for your household energy usage.\n\nComparePower is a no-cost consumer resource that has been in operation since 2009 to help Texans find and compare energy plans and rates. You are now able to compare electricity plans “apples to apples” without worrying about fees or taxes obscured by energy providers.\n\nComparePower helps you find your ideal plan through a simple comparison process that discloses all fees by comparing plans side by side, helping you choose the best retail provider with the lowest rate without wasting hours of your time calling different companies or sorting through countless websites.\n\n \n\n### Compare Pioneer Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nPioneer Energy is a Sugar Land-based retail electricity provider that serves residential and commercial customers. This provider has almost three decades of experience handling energy contracts throughout Texas.\n\nPioneer Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Pioneer Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Pioneer Energy residential plans\n\nPioneer Energy works with local utility providers to manage energy accounts for Texas residents. The company’s fixed-rate plans provide consistency in billing for budget-conscious consumers. Applicants can select contract lengths ranging from six months to three years depending on their needs. The contract length dictates the per kilowatt hours rate with longer contracts yielding lower rates.\n\nCustomers with Pioneer Energy pay minimum charges with their bills but the company does not charge a fee for low usage. The company charges an early termination fee for each customer who breaks contract prior to its expiration. Quotes available on the website do not include local or state taxes.\n\nA standard move-in request with Pioneer Energy requires at least three business days and up to 45 calendar days for completion. Customers who need to arrange moves within three business days of service can pay for priority move-in service with Pioneer Energy. The company requires a credit check prior to activation with a deposit necessary with poor credit.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n \n\n### Pioneer Energy commercial plans\n\nPioneer Energy works with small business clients in Texas. The company offers limited online information about its commercial plans. Small business owners can review rates using their zip code and apply a promo code if one is available. Pioneer Energy also encourages prospective commercial clients to submit their last utility bills, average usage, and desired terms via an online contact form.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Pioneer Energy customer service & bill payment\n\nThere are multiple points of contact available to Pioneer Energy who need assistance. Customers can call 1-888-569-1144 to speak with a customer service representative about their bills. The company does not handle service calls and directs customers to their local utility providers.\n\nA Pioneer Energy online account is available for any customer who wants to pay bills and manage service without calls or emails. Account holders only need their account number, zip code, email address, and login information to get started. The Quick Pay feature on Pioneer Energy’s website is a more direct route to bill payments. This feature only requires an account number, zip code, and phone number to pay bills.\n\nThe company’s website features a detailed contact form for non-urgent questions. Pioneer Energy offers an email address for customer questions and a fax number to cover all bases. It is also easy to engage with the company via Facebook and Twitter.\n\n \n\n### Pioneer Energy reviews\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Pioneer Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Pioneer Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/centralohio/business-reviews/utility-billing/pioneer-energy-management-inc-in-columbus-oh-3005764).\n- Read customer complaints about [Pioneer Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=RESQL01DB1245647900001&TXT_BEGIN=10/1/2017&TXT_END=3/31/2018)\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commission of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Power Express on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/energy-service-company/power-express-in-houston-tx-90044816).\n- Read customer complaints about [Power Express on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=RESQL01DB1245463600004&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018)\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

This happened because state legislation was passed to deregulate the industry and allow the market to set prices. Customers have the power to choose and there has never been a better time to shop for a new provider.\n\nComparePower is a free consumer service that helps Texas energy consumers choose the best plan for their household. The rates and plans for your household take a lot of research and calculations to find. Let ComparePower do the hard work and save you hours and hours of work.\n\nComparePower allows you to look at companies and their plans side by side. You won’t have to worry about hidden fees or bill surprises. ComparePower helps you know exactly what you will pay each month and allows you to switch seamlessly.\n\n \n\n### Compare Pronto Power rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nPronto Power is a subsidiary of Summer Energy that serves residential and commercial customers. This retail electricity provider serves customers in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region.\n\nPronto Power has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Pronto Power plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Pronto Power residential plans\n\nPronto Power differs from other retail energy providers by offering prepaid electrical plans to residential customers. A prepaid plan differs from a standard postpaid plan by drawing from money stored in the customer's account rather than sending bills each month. A customer can load their account, track their usage, and refill their account based on usage.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving?

The provider requests information including historical energy usage, company size, and location to determine quoted rates.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Pronto Power **customer service & bill payment**\n\nPronto Power accepts customer service calls at 1-888-234-1373 Monday through Saturday.

They've got these plans with free energy times - like nights or weekends.\n\nPretty neat, right?

The other hours might cost you more.\n\nSo, it's kinda like a seesaw - you gotta figure out if it balances out for your lifestyle. Worth checking out, but make sure you do the math before jumping in.\n\n### Making the Right Choice for You\n\nFinding the right electricity provider can feel like a puzzle, but don't worry - we've got your back.\n\nWhen you're sizing up Pulse Power (or any other company), think about what matters most to you.\n\nIs it rock-bottom prices? Eco-friendly options? A customer service team that won't make you want to pull your hair out?\n\nMake sure the plan fits you like a glove before you sign on the dotted line.\n\nGot questions?

Reliant gets props for being reliable and having a slick mobile app, but folks aren't thrilled about their prices.\n\nMany Redditors feel like they're paying extra just for the Reliant name.\n\nCirro, on the other hand, is the budget-friendly pick. Users love their wallet-friendly rates, but some say the customer service could use a boost.\n\nHere's the kicker: both companies catch flak for hiking up rates after the intro period. It's like a Texas-sized bait and switch!\n\nThe takeaway? Do your homework, compare plans carefully, and always read the fine print. Your perfect power match is out there, but you might need to dig a little to find it.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

Let's look at some sample rates to give you an idea of how these providers stack up.\n\n- [**Reliant**](#tab-strongreliantstrong)\n- [**Direct Energy**](#tab-strongdirectenergystrong)\n\n**<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"Texas\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"\" provider=\"41\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" pricingBasedOn=\"2000\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />**\n\n**<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"Texas\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"14\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />**\n\nWhile both companies have similar rates, it's important to remember that:\n\n1. **Rates fluctuate**: Electricity prices change frequently. The rates you see today might be different tomorrow.\n\n3. **Usage matters**: Your total bill depends on how much electricity you use. A plan that's cheaper at one usage level might be more expensive at another.\n\n5. **Discounts**: Both have plans with bill credits that can significantly affect pricing.\n\n**Pro tip:** The lowest advertised price isn't always the best option. To find the best deal, compare plans based on your household's unique energy needs and usage patterns.\n\nReady to lock in the best electricity rates for your home? Shop the right way today.\n\n**[Find your best plan with Live Link™ →](https://comparepower.com/live-link/)**\n\n## Reliant\n\nLooking for a solid electricity provider?\n\nReliant's got a good rep. They're known for treating customers well and offering all sorts of plans.\n\nWhether you're watching your budget or want some extra perks, they've probably got something for you.\n\n### Reliant Highlights\n\n- Known for excellent customer service\n\n- Wide variety of plans, including free nights and weekends options\n\n- Part of NRG Energy, a big player in Texas electricity\n\n- Multiple customer support channels: phone, email, or chat\n\n- Active involvement in Texas communities\n\n**Best for**: [Free Nights & Weekends](https://comparepower.com/providers/top-energy-companies/best-companies-for-free-nights-weekends/), [Same-Day Service](https://comparepower.com/providers/top-energy-companies/best-companies-for-same-day-electricity/), and [Customer Service](https://comparepower.com/providers/top-energy-companies/best-companies-for-customer-service/)\n\n## Direct Energy\n\nLooking for an electricity provider that gives you control?\n\nDirect Energy might be your match. They offer a variety of plans and some nifty tech to help you manage your energy use.\n\n### Direct Energy Highlights\n\n- Often offers more budget-friendly pricing\n\n- User-friendly app and online tools for usage tracking\n\n- Generally positive customer service reviews\n\n- Part of NRG Energy, a big player in Texas electricity\n\n- Great options for low-usage customers\n\n**Best for**: [Low Usage](https://comparepower.com/providers/top-energy-companies/best-companies-for-low-usage/) and [Customer Service](https://comparepower.com/providers/top-energy-companies/best-companies-for-customer-service/)\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Plans\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans from Reliant and Direct Energy\" />\n\n## Customer Reviews & Ratings\n\n**Reliant:** 4.5 stars on [Google (2500+ reviews)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Reliant+Energy/@31.1689103,-100.6371452,10z/data=!4m12!1m2!2m1!1sreliant+energy!3m8!1s0x864e82bc2cf619d5:0x6900991b5b218109!8m2!3d31.1689103!4d-100.0768425!9m1!1b1!15sCg5yZWxpYW50IGVuZXJneSIDiAEBkgEYZWxlY3RyaWNfdXRpbGl0eV9jb21wYW554AEA!16s%2Fg%2F1td7j45k?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAxNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Many customers appreciate their friendly reps and convenient plans\n\n- Positive reviews highlight excellent customer service and plan variety\n\nCommon complaints:\n\n- Some report issues with high bills and strict payment policies\n\n- Negative feedback mentions unexpected charges and confusing statements\n\n**Direct Energy:**\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Customers appreciate the friendly service and clear pricing\n\n- Many folks like their online tools and app for easy account management\n\n- Some users rave about their helpful customer support team\n\nCommon complaints:\n\n- A few customers ran into billing hiccups and communication issues\n\n- Negative reviews mention unexpected fees and disconnection problems\n\n### Reliant vs. Direct Energy: Reddit's Take\n\nReddit users have some strong opinions about Reliant and Direct Energy. Both are big players in the Texas electricity game, but they've got their own quirks.\n\nReliant gets a pat on the back for their customer service. Folks say they're pretty upfront about things, which is always nice. But here's the kicker - their prices might make your wallet a bit lighter than some other options.\n\nTheir \"free nights\" plans? Some people swear by 'em, others think they're just clever marketing.\n\nDirect Energy, on the other hand, often wins the price game. If you're watching your pennies, they might be your best bet. But watch out - their customer service gets some side-eye. Some users have had real headaches sorting out billing issues and disputes.\n\nThe main advice?\n\nDo your homework, y'all. Remember, the cheapest plan isn't always the best if it's giving you gray hairs from frustration. And what works for your neighbor might not be the best fit for your home.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

Do your homework.\n\nCompare plans and find what works for you. Just remember – what's perfect for your neighbor might not be the best fit for your home.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

But watch out for tricky billing, say others.\n\nReliant doesn't get much specific chatter, but it's often grouped with other big companies that might not offer the best deals.\n\nThe main advice? Do your homework.\n\nCompare plans and find what works for you. Remember, your neighbor's perfect plan might not be the best fit for your home.\n\n## What No One’s Telling You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

Electricity providers are adjusting their rates to compete for your business. You should review available plans in your area before committing to a Smart Prepaid Electric plan.\n\nComparePower takes care of the hard work when searching for your next electricity plan.

ComparePower allows a simple comparison of available plans and includes taxes and fees in its quotes.\n\nInstead of spending hours researching electricity plans, ComparePower can deliver plan information to you in minutes. The best rates on electricity are available by heading to ComparePower. \n\n \n\n### Compare Smart Prepaid Electric rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nSmart Prepaid Electric is a Houston-based energy provider with a different model from traditional retail providers. The company requires users to have smart meters and utilizes a prepaid model rather than a traditional billing model. Customers of Smart Prepaid Electric load their account balances before usage and reload based on consumption similar to a prepaid phone.\n\nSmart Prepaid Electric has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Smart Prepaid Electric plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon.

This meter needs to be installed and in operation for at least 30 days prior to account registration. Smart Prepaid Electric also works with local utility providers to evaluate if smart meters are operating correctly for proper billing. The company does not require a credit check or deposit due to its prepaid billing model.\n\nNew customers must submit their home address in order to determine qualification for service. If qualified, a user indicates whether they are moving, the move-in date, and the type of residence. Smart Prepaid Electric lists several payment amounts available to the customer and rate information. For each initial payment amount, a customer knows the utility fee, processing fee, tax, amount of kilowatt hours purchased, and estimated days purchased based on typical usage for the property.\n\nSmart Prepaid Electric notes several distinctions from other retail energy providers on its website. The company requires opt-in from customers for mailed billing statements and sends email statements to customers upon request. Smart Prepaid Electric charges a fee for every mailed statement. Customers who fall below $10 on their accounts will see disconnection of their service because smart meter data processing lags behind real-time usage.\n\n### Smart Prepaid Electric **commercial plans**\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Smart Prepaid Electric **customer service & bill payment** \n\nSmart Prepaid Electric’s prepaid model means that customers need multiple options to keep their account balances in line with their energy usage. The company’s online account management tool allows a user to review energy use and reload their accounts using debit or credit cards. An online account with Smart Prepaid Electric also features a top-up option for automatic reloads at designated account balances. Smart Prepaid Electric also allows payment by reloadable Smart Card, which can be purchased at ACE Cash Express retail locations and reloaded in person or by phone. The provider charges a payment processing fee for all payments to encourage larger payments.\n\nCustomers looking for more traditional methods of payment have two options with Smart Prepaid Electric. The company’s 877 line can be used for account reloads as well as account inquiries from Monday through Saturday. Smart Prepaid Electric also allows payment by mail order to the company’s mailing address\n\n \n\n### **Smart Prepaid Electric reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Smart Prepaid Electric?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias.

The company’s fixed-rate plans solidify rates through the end of contracts, while the company’s flex plans allow customers to ride the peaks and valleys of market pricing. New customers and renewers need to consider contract length ranging from three months to three years. Short contracts allow account holders to shop around for better rates at contract expiration. Long contracts are ideal for consumers who are settled into their homes and looking for lower monthly rates.\n\nSouthwest Power and Light offer temporary and month-to-month plans for customers who want the ability to switch providers based on changing circumstances. The company’s Plant-A-Tree plans take advantage of a partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation. Southwest Power and Light sponsors a tree for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours consumed by Plant-A-Tree account holders. Customers with varying energy use each month can select plans with no minimum use limits.\n\nExisting customers can lower their monthly bills by referring customers to Southwest Power and Light. The company’s referral program allows an account holder to receive bill credits for each referred customer. This program also issues bill credits to the referred person. Southwest Power and Light only offer referral bonuses for new fixed-rate plans.\n\n \n\n**Southwest Power and Light commercial plans**\n\nCommercial customers receive limited information about Southwest Power and Light's plans through its website. The company encourages business owners to contact 866-941-7975 for quotes and consultations. Southwest Power and Light features a dedicated portal and comprehensive billing for commercial customers.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies.

There are hundreds of energy companies competing for your business. Before signing up for a Stream Energy plan you should shop and compare rates from other providers to ensure you are in fact getting the lowest possible rate available for your specific situation.\n\nComparePower is a free consumer service established in 2009 to help Texans searching for their best energy plan. Plans for many different electricity providers are shown in a simple format where seeing the total cost is easy and transparent. That makes comparing your options simple and fast.\n\nComparePower discloses all fees by comparing plans “apples to apples”, helping you choose the best provider with the lowest rate without consuming hours of your time calling different energy companies or sorting through hundreds of websites.\n\n \n\n### Compare Stream Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nSupplying energy to residents and businesses in Texas since 2005, Stream Energy has expanded into a nationwide company that is one of the largest providers willing to sell directly to consumers.\n\nWith headquarters in Dallas, Texas, Stream Energy was founded in 2005 with the simple business model of selling energy via word of mouth using direct sales techniques as part of its multi-level marketing (MLM) business model.\n\nStream Energy provides plans with bonuses like free rates during certain times of the week and has placed associates all across Texas that can provide local support.

Read this before you take the plunge.\n\nStream Energy offers income-generating opportunities for its customers as well as its sales associates. Sales associates usually start as customers before pursuing Stream's business opportunity.\n\nThere are five levels of the independent associate and three leadership levels that determine compensation types and amounts. Stream Energy boasts many ways to make money with this opportunity that include monthly energy income, quick start bonuses, leadership income and residual income.\n\nBefore giving up your day job to become a Stream Energy sales associate you should know that [Pyramid Scheme Alert](https://pyramidschemealert.org), a watchdog agency, reported less than one percent of Stream sales associates made enough money to live on with the program.\n\nRobert FitzPatrick, who runs the watchdog group, examined income disclosures from Stream’s website for [The Atlanta Journal-Constitution](https://www.ajc.com/business/selling-energy-and-prosperity/8l22tkxvVR1JsrMp2aqIFJ/).\n\nFitzpatrick, who has served as an expert witness in pyramid cases, claims his calculations show 90 percent of Stream’s sales force lost nearly all their investments; 8.5 percent made no profit; only 1 percent made what he said amounts to minimum wage-level income and fewer than 0.1 percent earned a substantial income.\n\nNearly 90 percent of associates lost all of the money that they invested with Stream Energy, which includes an initial entrance fee of $329 and a $29 monthly maintenance fee.\n\n \n\n### **ComparePower affiliate program**\n\nIf you are serious about earning income selling energy in Texas you should consider the ComparePower Affiliate Program.\n\nComparePower has been in business since 2009 and has helped over 750,000 Texans find the best electricity rates to power their homes.\n\nOur affiliate program offers an opportunity to earn income selling the plans of dozens of electricity providers in Texas.  No costly initial entrance, monthly fees or multilevel marketing tactics required.\n\nSerious inquiries can [email us](mailto:support@comparepower.com) for more information.\n\n \n\n### **Stream Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Stream Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias.

Summer Energy notes that disconnection or reconnection payments should be made through the company rather than a third-party company.\n\n \n\n### **Summer Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Summer Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Summer Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/electric-companies/summer-energy-llc-in-houston-tx-90027799).\n- Read customer complaints about [Summer Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=RESQL01DB1245580400001&TXT_BEGIN=10/1/2017&TXT_END=3/31/2018)\n\nThe Energy Professionals Association (TEPA) gave Summer Energy its Supplier of the Year award for 2017. TEPA named Summer Energy based on voting by energy brokers and consultants familiar with the company’s customer service reputation. The company was a finalist for the same award in 2016.\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

    "_mdxContent": "\nWhether new to Texas, a long-time resident, or a business owner, this guide provides useful information on Texans Energy and allows you to compare rates from other Texas energy companies so that you can find your best solution to power your home or business.\n\nAny product or company names, marks or logos shown on this page are the property of their respective owners. ComparePower is an independent marketplace offering free electricity pricing comparisons for consumers.\n\nTime to read: about 5 min\n\n**Sections in this guide:** Click on a section below to skip directly to it.\n\n1. **[Texans Energy electric choice in Texas](#ElectricChoice)**\n2. **[Compare Texans Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans](#CompareRates)**\n3. **[How to choose the best energy plan in Texas (know your usage!)](#HowTo)**\n4. **[Texans Energy residential energy plans](#Residential)**\n5. **[Texans Energy business energy plans](#Business)**\n6. **[Texans Energy customer service & bill payment](#CustomerService)**\n7. **[Texans Energy reviews](#Reviews)**\n8. **[Texas energy companies](#Companies)**\n9. **[Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas](#Cities)**\n10. **[Shop electricity rates by Texas zip codes](#ZipCodes)**\n11. **[Electricity rates by utility service areas in Texas](#Utilities)**\n\n \n\n### **Texans Energy electric choice in Texas**\n\nDeregulation has transformed the energy market in Texas. A law was passed in 2002, setting the process into motion. Since then, companies have been competing for the business of residents in service areas all across the state.\n\nWith hundreds of companies and plans to choose from, the choice seems impossible. ComparePower is here to do the hard work for you and make sure you choose the right plan. From spreadsheets and calculations to calling and researching, they will ensure that you have all the information you need.\n\nComparePower also has the inside scoop on hidden fees and will include those charges in their plan comparisons. This means that you get to see prices “apples to apples” and will be able to choose the plan that works best for your household and your budget.\n\n \n\n### Compare Texans Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nTexans Energy was founded in 2007 to serve customers throughout the state. This retail electricity provider serves residential and commercial clients from its Houston headquarters.\n\nTexans Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Texans Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Texans Energy residential plans\n\nResidential electricity plans with Texans Energy cater to different customer needs. The company offers a variable-rate plan that prices electricity based on changes in the energy market. The company's no-fee plan features no minimum charge each month. Texans Energy also offers a fixed-rate plan with free nights and weekends.\n\nSwitching providers? Energy rates on ComparePower can be customized to your specific historical power usage.\n\nMoving? ComparePower helps you estimate your new home's energy usage, ensuring you choose the best plan for your household.\n\nLock in the best rate by comparing competing energy plans on ComparePower. Enter your zip code to start comparing energy company plans for your specific usage in your service area.\n\n \n\n### Texans Energy **business plans**\n\nTexans Energy does not publish business electricity plans on its website. Businesses researching Texans Energy's commercial plans can reach out via email to receive customized quotes based on their average monthly usage rates.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Texans Energy **customer service & bill payment**\n\nTexans Energy's customer support team can be reached at (855) 508-3926 Monday through Friday. Customers looking for bill payment options can use the following methods:\n\n- **Pay Online:** Customers can pay online by signing into their accounts or using their account numbers on the Texans Energy website.\n- **Pay by Mail:** Send checks to the following address: 2150 Town Square Place – Suite 711, Sugar Land, Texas 77479\n- **Pay by Phone:** Call 855-508-3926 in order to give the operator your credit or debit card information.\n\n### [](#_ftnref1)**Texans Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Texans Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Texans Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/electric-companies/texans-energy-in-sugar-land-tx-90004666).\n- Read customer complaints about [Texans Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=ELSQL01DB1245430700001&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018).\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

Companies are now seeking your business by presenting affordable rates. Before you decide to sign up for a Think Energy plan, you should review your options and determine plans that meet your needs.\n\nComparePower works to do just that as a free service that has been helping clients since 2009. You are now able to place plans side by side without having to worry about hidden fees or gimmicks that were not disclosed by salespeople. ComparePower helps you find the best plan through an easy-to-use comparison tool.\n\nWhile you would normally spend hours filling in spreadsheets and keeping track of calculations, ComparePower does the hard work for you. All you have to do is follow their lead and you will find the best rates for your household today.\n\n \n\n### Compare Think Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nThink Energy has been providing retail electricity services to Texas consumers since its founding in 2011. This Pennsylvania-based company helps customers in the service areas for AEP Texas, CenterPoint Energy, Oncor, and Texas-New Mexico Power. Think Energy also serves customers in 12 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nThink Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n \n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Think Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n### Think Energy residential plans\n\nThink Energy provides customers with different contract lengths and energy rates depending on location. The standard Think Simple plans are available with six, 12, 18, and 24-month contracts.\n\nEach plan features an early cancellation fee and no upfront costs. The length of the contract determines the fixed rate with the highest rate in the six-month contract and the lowest rate in the 24-month contract.\n\n \n\n### Think Energy **commercial plans**\n\nThink Energy also provides service to small businesses throughout Texas. The company’s business plans are available with six, 12, 18, 24, and 36-month contracts.\n\nA business customer does not pay an initial fee and longer contracts mean lower per kilowatt hour rates. Think Energy charges a cancellation fee of $50 times the number of months remaining on the contract.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### Think Energy **customer service**\n\nThink Energy provides a chat function for customers who are completing residential or commercial applications. This chat feature pops up automatically when the application form appears, allowing dialogue with a customer service representative throughout the process.\n\nNew customers or long-time account holders have other options if they need assistance from Think Energy. The company offers separate emails for general questions and customer service along with a customer service phone line. Think Energy also features a Contact form for general questions that do not require an immediate response.\n\nBecause Think Energy is a retail energy provider, the company does not handle outage or other utility service questions. The Think Energy website maintains an Outage Center with phone numbers for each utility provider in its service areas.\n\n \n\n### **Think Energy payment** \n\nThe typical Think Energy bill features a summary of the current month’s charges, a comparison of energy use for the current year, and the amount due. Customers also receive a notice of their right to dispute bills by contacting the Texas Public Utility Commission.\n\nThink Energy allows account holders to pay by mail or access their online accounts for online payment. The company also informs bill recipients that they can donate to the Thinking About Texans Program, which provides energy assistance to low-income families.\n\n \n\n### **Think Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for Think Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [Think Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/energy-management-consultant/think-energy-in-houston-tx-31003354).\n- Read customer complaints about [Think Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=RESQL01DB1245577100001&TXT_BEGIN=10/1/2017&TXT_END=3/31/2018)\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

But it's not so complicated once you know a few key things. Let's break it down!\n\nThis shake-up has sparked plenty of competition, leading to a buffet of plan options, prices, and customer service levels.\n\nHere's the deal with Texas electricity: You get to pick your Retail Electric Provider (REP) - they're the ones who set up your plan, decide your prices, and send you bills.\n\nBut here's the twist: They don't actually bring the electricity to your house. That job belongs to the Transmission and Distribution Utilities (TDUs).\n\nSo while you can shop around for REPs all day long, the folks keeping your lights on and fixing power lines when things go haywire? That's your local TDU, and they're the same no matter which REP you go with.\n\nHere's a quick guide to navigating the [**Texas deregulated energy**](https://comparepower.com/what-is-energy-choice/) scene to find what works best for you:\n\n**Power to Choose**: Texas's open market means you have the [**power to choose**](https://comparepower.com/power-to-choose-texas/) your electricity provider based on what's important to you, whether that's price, contract length, customer service, or green energy options.\n\n**Plan Types**: You'll find a mix of [**fixed-rate and variable-rate**](https://comparepower.com/fixed-rate-vs-variable-rate-electricity/) plans. Fixed-rate plans mean your price stays the same for a certain period, offering stability. Variable-rate plans change with the market, which could save you money when rates drop.\n\n**Going Green**: Many providers in Texas have [**green energy plans**](https://comparepower.com/green-renewable-energy-companies-plans-rates/) that use wind, solar, or water energy. Opting for one of these plans is a great way to support renewable energy.\n\n**Compare to Save**: Shopping around is the secret to landing the best deal. Compare different plans and rates from several companies to find the perfect fit.\n\n**Bill Breakdown**: Understanding your [**electric bill**](https://comparepower.com/charges-electric-bill/) is crucial. It usually includes energy costs, transmission fees, and extra charges or taxes. Understanding this can help you compare deals better.\n\n**Contract Lengths**: **[Electricity contracts](https://comparepower.com/short-term-vs-long-term-electricity-contract-lengths/)** can range from flexible month-to-month plans to longer commitments. Consider what suits your lifestyle, and watch for early termination fees if you switch before your contract ends.\n\nWith these points in mind, you can navigate the Texas energy market like a pro and choose an electricity plan that fits your needs and budget. The power is yours.\n\n### Best Texas Energy Companies FAQs\n\n{/* FaqRankMath disabled - JSON escaping issues\n<FaqRankMath questions={[{\"id\":\"faq-question-1727987723887\",\"title\":\"<strong>How do I choose the best energy company in Texas?</strong>\",\"content\":\"Quick and easy: Sign up for Live Link™, compare plans with the real cost for your home, and find the perfect balance of price and features.<br><br>DIY: Gather up a year of historical usage for your home, drop it into our powerful tools, and pick a great plan for your home.<br><br>Either path you choose, you’ll end up with the best plan for your home.

(April 15, 2023)\n\nTo avoid overpaying, comparing energy plans based on your home's kWh usage is important.\n\nMany Texans believe shopping for electricity is similar to buying gasoline.\n\nYou see $3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons and pay $30. The math is simple.\n\nHowever, shopping for electricity isn't the same. Each plan has its unique formula to calculate your monthly bill.\n\nThe advertised price per kilowatt-hour only applies to the specific EFL usage (usually 500, 1000, or 2000 kWh).\n\nYou only get the advertised price using the exact corresponding kWh.

Do your research! Compare plans carefully and pay attention to the details to avoid surprises.\n\n## What They Don't Tell You\n\n**1\\. Same power, different name**. No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

No matter who you pick a plan from, your electricity is delivered by the same company—your [TDU](https://comparepower.com/texas-electricity-transmission-distribution/) (Transmission and Distribution Utilities) .\n\nTDUs like [CenterPoint](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/centerpoint-energy/) in Houston or [Oncor](https://comparepower.com/utilities/texas/oncor/) in Dallas own and maintain the poles and wires that deliver electricity.\n\nThis means your power’s [reliability is the same](https://comparepower.com/electricity-reliability/) no matter who you sign up with. And the [Public Utility Commission of Texas](https://comparepower.com/texas-puc/) (PUCT) oversees and regulates all of them.\n\nSo the brand itself doesn’t impact the electricity you receive. Now why would you [pay extra for a bigger name?](https://comparepower.com/why-pay-more-for-electricity/)\n\n**2\\. Advertised rates are a trap**. You’ve probably seen ads for ultra-low rates. But those rates are usually tied to [exact usage amounts](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-are-a-trap/)—500 or 1,000 kWh.\n\nThose [rates](https://comparepower.com/advertised-electricity-rates-explained/) look great on paper but are almost impossible to hit in real life.\n\nWhy?\n\nEvery month you use a different amount of electricity, so the rate you see [might not be the rate you pay](https://comparepower.com/why-your-electric-plan-might-be-causing-high-bills/).\n\n**3\\. Beware of holdover rates**. What happens when your contract expires?\n\nIf you don’t [switch to a new plan](https://comparepower.com/how-to-switch-energy-companies/), you’re now the winner of a [holdover rate](https://comparepower.com/holdover-rates/).\n\nHoldover rates equal big bills, especially during Texas heatwaves or winter storms.\n\nDon’t let your [contract lapse](https://comparepower.com/expired-electric-contract-costing-you/)—always [switch or renew](https://comparepower.com/contract-expiring-how-electricity-renewals-work-in-texas/) your plan before it expires.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Shop for plans in a [comparison marketplace](https://comparepower.com/comparepower-vs-direct-electricity-shopping/) to get a complete picture of the best available options based on your actual usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Compare Rates\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Plans & Rates in Texas\" />\n\n## How to Choose the Right Plan\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by all these electricity options.

Companies are now competing for your business and adjusting their rates to be competitive. Before you decide to sign up for a V247 Power plan, you should examine your options and determine what is right for you.\n\nComparePower endeavors to do just that as a no-cost consumer service that has been in operation since 2009. You are now able to compare plans without having to worry about hidden costs not disclosed by sales representatives. ComparePower helps you find the right plan through a fast and straightforward comparison process.\n\nWhile you would typically spend hours filling in spreadsheets and keeping track of calculations, ComparePower does the hard work for you. All you have to do is follow their lead, and you will find the best rates for your household today.\n\n## Compare V247 Power with competing Texas energy plans\n\nV247 Power is an electricity retailer that has served customers throughout Texas since opening in 2012. This Houston-based company serves customers in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) service area. This service area features major electricity providers like Centerpoint Energy, Oncor, and Texas-New Mexico Power. Read on to learn more about V247 Power and to compare rates with other great Texas energy companies.\n\nV247 Power has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a V247 Power plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoiding overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, and pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n### V247 Power residential energy plans\n\nV247 Power offers residential electrical plans and promotions designed to keep prices competitive with other Texas electricity providers. Customers choose contract lengths of one, two, or three years depending on their energy needs. A shorter contract with V247 Power allows flexibility to seek lower prices, while a more extended contract can lock in a favorable rate.\n\nOne of the ongoing promotions used by V247 Power is the Free Weekends plan. This plan allows the user to receive no-cost electricity from midnight Saturday through 11:59 pm Sunday for the duration of the contract. V247 Power offers 100 days of free electricity as part of this plan. The Free Weekends plan is available to customers using smart meters.\n\n### **V247 Power commercial energy plans**\n\nIn addition to residential service, V247 Power provides business plans for small companies and established corporations. A small business account with V247 Power starts with a $0 base rate. The retailer’s customer service team also provides free consultations on energy plans that fit the account holder’s needs.\n\nA business account applicant with $10,000 per month or more in electrical expenses qualifies for a large business plan. This level of consumption can lead to significant swings in energy use depending on the time of year, the number of employees, and the company’s overall level of demand. V247 Power works with large businesses to customize plans in anticipation of these variables.\n\nTo find the best electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies.

ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commission of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [V247 Power on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/electric-companies/v247-power-corporation-in-houston-tx-22015202).\n- Read customer complaints about [V247 Power on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=RESQL01DB1245544000001&TXT_BEGIN=10/1/2017&TXT_END=3/31/2018)\n\n## Popular Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

Our veterans deserve the best prices. ComparePower provides instant rate comparisons to ensure you are getting the best available electricity prices.\n\n<WpBlock60549_Unknown />\n\n## **Veteran Energy electric choice in Texas**\n\nTexas electricity is deregulated giving you the power to choose your retail electricity company. Hundreds of electricity providers compete for the opportunity to power your home. Before signing up for a Veteran Energy plan you should shop and compare prices from other electricity companies to make sure you get the best rate available for your family.\n\nComparePower is a free service established in 2009 to help Texans search for their best retail electricity plan. Plans from hundreds of companies are shown simply where the total cost is right in front of you. That makes comparing your electricity plan options fast and easy.\n\nComparePower shows all fees by displaying plans “apples to apples,” helping you select the best electricity plan with the lowest price without spending too much of your precious time calling electricity companies or reading through a ton of online content.\n\n## Compare Veteran Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nVeteran Energy was founded in 2010 with dual purposes of providing electricity service and supporting US veterans. The company provides competitively priced electricity and donates a portion of each customer’s bill to a veteran support organization of the customer’s choosing.\n\nVeteran Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n## How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a Veteran Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoiding overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, and pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n## Veteran Energy residential plans\n\nVeteran Energy sells retail electricity to customers in the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) service area.

You have never had more power to select your ideal electricity plan. Energy providers are competing for your account with adjusted rates, rebates, and bill credits. You should consider your plan options before signing up for a Viridian Energy plan.\n\nComparePower makes it easy to consider electricity plans in your city.

The company also offers a term-free plan for customers who want the flexibility to switch to another plan depending on market prices. Each plan guarantees that 50% of supplied energy comes from renewable energy including wind and solar sources. Viridian Energy charges an early termination fee of $199 on fixed-rate plans.\n\nViridian Energy offers solar power options through local partners in Texas. The company’s energy consultants can use satellite images to determine whether solar panels can save money for residential consumers. Viridian Energy provides multiple solar energy plans, panel monitoring, and coverage for repairs.\n\nThe renewable energy incentive from Viridian Energy allows customers to offset emissions for all of their energy usage. This promotion means that Viridian buys Renewable Energy Certificates to fill the gap between a customer’s total energy usage and the supplied renewable energy. Viridian Energy also offers a renewable energy program for natural gas customers.\n\nNew customers can also purchase smart meters with their Viridian Energy accounts. This offer allows a customer to monitor energy usage and reduce bills by turning down the heat or air conditioning.

That all changed when legislation was passed to deregulate the industry. Now, hundreds of companies have flooded the market and are driving down the prices. You finally have the power to choose.\n\nThe choice can be hard, though, with so many companies and plans to look at. That is why ComparePower was established in 2009 as a free consumer service. It does the heavy lifting, through research and calculations, that would take customers hours and hours.\n\nWhen you look for energy providers through ComparePower, you are able to see rates and plans listed together. You can rest assured that you won’t be blindsided by any hidden fees or extra charges. ComparePower includes them all in the price listed and helps you to make an informed decision about switching providers.\n\n \n\n### Compare WTU Energy rates with competing Texas energy plans\n\nWTU Energy provides retail energy services to customers in western Texas. This Houston-based company was certified by the Public Utility Commission of Texas in 2001.\n\nWTU Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n \n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a WTU Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage.

The company entered the Texas electricity market when Texas deregulated in 2002.\n\nYEP Energy has some great rates in Texas, but before you sign up you should shop rates from other providers to ensure you are getting the best rate possible.  The rates presented here are updated live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n \n\n<RatesTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" showUtility=\"\" showProvider=\"true\" provider=\"\" utility=\"3\" excludeProviders=\"\" priceUnit=\"dollar\" table-max-width=\"800px\" appendTableExtras=\"true\" linkPlanToPopup=\"true\" />\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Instantly compare competing Texas electricity plans and rates:**\" />\n\n \n\n### How to choose the best electricity plan in Texas\n\nSelecting a YEP Energy plan without knowing your home’s energy usage can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n**The #1 most important thing: Know your usage!**\n\nThe key to avoid overpaying is knowing your expected usage and comparing monthly costs for each plan based on that usage amount.\n\nWith things like gasoline, the \"price per gallon\" you see on the sign is the price you pay no matter how many gallons you pump.\n\n$3 per gallon. Pump 10 gallons, pay $30. Simple.\n\nElectricity in Texas is not as simple as buying gasoline. The advertised \"price per kWh\" is based on a specific, exact monthly usage (usually 2000 kWh).\n\nAnd, each plan has a different calculation for how your monthly bill is determined.\n\nYour effective \"price per kWh\" can only be determined by calculating your monthly bill, then dividing that monthly bill by your usage.\n\nAdvertised \"price per kWh\" can be misleading because it's based on a specific usage like 2000 kWh. It's best to shop based on the total bill for your home's expected usage.\n\nHow do you do that when the math is complicated, and every plan is a little different?\n\nComparePower has already done all this complicated math for you.\n\nFirst, we help you determine your expected monthly kWh usage. Then we show you the plans and their total monthly cost for your usage.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Click to Compare\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"**Enter your zip code for guidance choosing your best rate plan:**\" />\n\n \n\n \n\n### YEP Energy residential plans\n\nYEP Energy has a wide array of electricity plans to meet your needs. The company offers traditional and renewable energy plans with terms of 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months.\n\nYEP also has energy plans that help customers support US military service members. They have partnered with the USO to allow customers to directly support US troops and their families. For every 1000 kilowatt hours consumed under their USO-sponsored plan, they make a contribution of $3 to the USO’s Warrior and Family Care Program. These plans are available in 6, 12, 24, and 36-month terms.\n\n \n\n### YEP Energy **commercial plans**\n\nYEP Energy does not offer standard commercial plans. Prospective business clients contact YEP Energy to receive customized rates.\n\nTo find the best commercial electricity rates, you need to compare prices from competing energy companies. ComparePower bridges the gap between your business and energy companies by inviting various energy providers to compete for your business in a sealed bid process.\n\nYou submit your information once and the providers will present their bids.  You to choose the cheapest price.  Simple, quick, and easy.\n\n**[Click here](https://comparepower.com/electricity-rates/texas/business-commercial-electricity) to get competing quotes for your business electricity.**\n\n \n\n### YEP Energy **customer service**\n\nYEP Energy has call center employees who speak Spanish and Korean fluently so customers and potential customers can communicate without translators. Their customer service center is open Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. CST.\n\n**YEP Energy customer service line:**\n\n713.358.8508\n\n866.577.0423 (toll-free)\n\n**YEP Energy customer service email:**\n\n[customer.care@yeptexas.com](mailto:customer.care@yeptexas.com)\n\nYEP customers have several ways to pay bills. No matter how you normally pay your monthly bills, there’s bound to be a way to pay your YEP bill that fits your lifestyle.\n\n- **Pay online** through YEP Energy’s website.\n- **Pay by phone** by calling 866-937-5937.\n- **Pay by mail**: YEP, Attention: Customer Care, PO Box 3079, Houston, TX 77253\n- **Pay in person** at various retail payment stores such as Ace Cash Express, H-E-B grocery stores, and Randall’s grocery stores.\n\n \n\n### **YEP Energy reviews**\n\nLooking for ratings and reviews for YEP Energy?\n\nSeveral companies rate electricity providers. ComparePower does not include customer reviews as they are generally biased or easy to manipulate and skew one way or the other (positive or negative).\n\nOften, a review is requested a mere few days after enrolling in a new energy plan, which may not be an adequate amount of time for a customer to experience the product or service.\n\nMany customers who take the time to leave feedback typically do so as an effort to resolve a problem and are using negative feedback as a forum to draw attention to their issue.\n\nCustomers who leave positive reviews are generally incentivized to do so and therefore tend to be biased.\n\nSo what are we left with?  There are a few long-standing customer review portals that attempt to remove bias. One of these is the Better Business Bureau and the other is the Public Utility Commision of Texas.\n\n- Read customer reviews and ratings about [YEP Energy on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website.](https://www.bbb.org/houston/business-reviews/electric-companies/yep-energy-in-houston-tx-58001746)\n- Read customer complaints about [YEP Energy on the Public Utility Commission of Texas website.](https://www.puc.texas.gov/consumer/electricity/graph.aspx?TXT_KEY=ELSQL01DB1245390600003&TXT_BEGIN=10/31/2017&TXT_END=4/30/2018)\n\n \n\n### Texas energy companies\n\nAre you trying to find an excellent electricity company in Texas?\n\nInstantly enroll for service with great electricity providers such as TXU Energy, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain and more.\n\nClick on the provider of your choice to view rates, learn more, or sign up.\n\n<ProvidersPhoneTable state=\"TX\" city=\"\" />\n\n \n\n### Electricity rates by popular cities in Texas\n\nLooking for a low electricity rate in your city?

But no stress – this guide's here to help.\n\nWe'll walk you through your options so you can find what fits you perfectly.\n\n### Electricity Plan 101 for Texas Apartments: Fixed or Variable? That's the Question\n\nIn the Lone Star State, you've got two main choices for your electricity plan: fixed-rate or variable-rate.\n\nPicture this: with a fixed-rate plan, your electricity rate is like your rent – it stays the same every month. The only thing that impacts your bill is your usage.\n\nBut with a variable-rate plan, your rate will change each month, kind of like how gas prices go up and down.\n\nAwesome when prices are down, but watch out, as your bills could climb when rates rise.\n\n### Picking Your Perfect Electricity Provider for Your Texas Pad\n\nPicking an electricity provider goes beyond just the price.\n\nConsider their customer service reputation, watch out for any hidden fees, and check out the perks tailored for apartment living.\n\nRemember, the cheapest option isn't always the best deal in the long run.\n\n### Apartment Electricity FAQs\n\n**What should I consider when choosing the best electricity plan for my apartment?**\n\nConsider your electricity use and your budget.\n\nFixed-rate plans give you consistent pricing, while variable-rate plans offer more flexibility but can be less stable in terms of cost.\n\nAnd don’t worry about matching your contract to your lease. Any time you move you can cancel your plan without extra fees.\n\n**How do fixed-rate and variable-rate plans differ?**\n\nFixed-rate plans secure your electricity rate, guaranteeing steady bills for the length of your contract.\n\nOn the flip side, variable-rate plans change with the market, which might save you money when rates drop but could hike up your expenses if rates climb.\n\n**What should I know about setting up new electricity service in my apartment?**\n\nKeep an eye on setup fees, shop on Compare Power regardless of recommendations, and get a clear understanding of how billing works for your particular living situation.\n\nTry to schedule your start date ahead of time. Most apartment complexes will require you to get an electricity plan before you get your keys.\n\n**Are there differences in electricity needs for apartments versus houses?**\n\nYes, apartments often use less electricity because they're smaller and share some infrastructure, which can affect which type of plan is most cost-effective for you.\n\n**Can I switch electricity providers? Are there penalties?**\n\nYou can switch providers anytime, just keep an eye out for any early termination fees. The last two weeks of your contract let you switch without getting charged.\n\nWant to dive deeper into apartment electricity?\n\nCheck out our rundown on [](https://comparepower.com/green-renewable-energy-companies-plans-rates/)[Apartment Electricity Plans](https://comparepower.com/apartment-electricity/)\n\n## How to Choose the Best Electricity Company\n\nWant the best electricity company for your home? Shop with your usage.\n\nHere's how ⤵️\n\n<WpBlock77727_CpVideoPopup />\n\n### Tips for Choosing the Right Plan\n\nNow that you've got the scoop on the best companies for customer service, here are some pointers to help you decide:\n\n**Think about how much energy you use**: Figure out your energy use to pick a plan that fits without paying too much.\n\nNot sure about your electricity usage? No worries! Just head over to our [kWh calculator](https://comparepower.com/kwh-electricity-energy-usage-calculator/) – it's like having a super-smart friend help you figure it out.\n\n**Compare prices and how long the plan lasts**: Check out different plans to find the one that feels right for you in terms of cost and time. Sometimes a longer plan can save you more money.\n\n👉 FYI: You can cancel your contract without an Early Termination Fee any time you move.\n\n**Keep an eye on the rate per kWh**: there might be different rates for using more or less.\n\n**Be alert for extra fee:**, like if you decide to leave the contract early or if there's a minimum amount of energy you need to use.\n\n**Think about the environment**: If you care about being green, check out plans that use renewable energy.\n\n**Make sure they've got your back**: Good customer service is key for those times you need a hand.\n\n## Simplify Power Connections in Your Rental\n\nMaking electricity setup a breeze begins with picking a provider that gets apartment living.\n\nUse Compare Power to check out different companies and their plans, finding competitive prices, satisfaction promises, and perks that suit renters perfectly.\n\nThen, enjoy smooth sign-up with one of Texas' best electricity providers for apartment residents.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Get Started\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Rates Near You\" />\n",

We've all been through the drill: blazing hot summers and those chilly winters.\n\nBut guess what? You can save a lot on your electricity bills by using usage discounts.\n\nThis guide will show you how. Let's dive in and make saving money as straightforward as possible.\n\n### How to Rock Bill Credits\n\nBill credits give you a break on your bill when you use more electricity, but only up to a certain point.\n\nFor example, using more than 1,000 kWh monthly could mean a lower rate for you.\n\nIt's an effective way to save money by adjusting when you use your electricity.\n\n**Diving Into Rates and Usage**: Each electricity provider offers different discount deals.\n\nSome may offer significant savings once you hit 2,000 kWh, which is perfect for large households but might not benefit someone living alone as much.\n\n**How to Maximize Discounts Through Smart Use**: Review your previous electricity bills to get an idea of your average usage.\n\nThen, consider timing your major electricity-consuming activities, like using the air conditioner, to coincide with those discount periods.\n\n**Strategies for Optimal Savings**: Tools like programmable thermostats, energy-efficient appliances, and smart home systems can be beneficial.\n\nRunning your dishwasher or washing machine during off-peak hours when lower rates can lead to substantial savings.\n\n### Common Concerns About Bill Credit Plans\n\n**\"What if I don't use enough electricity to qualify for the discounts?\"**\n\nDon't worry. Many providers offer usage discount plans with tiers starting as low as 500 kWh per month, so even smaller households can benefit.\n\n**\"Will I be penalized for using too much power?\"**\n\nNope. Usage discount plans are designed to reward you for your consumption, not penalize you.\n\nThe more electricity you use, the more you can save.\n\n**\"Are these plans more expensive than regular fixed-rate plans?\"**\n\nNot necessarily. While some usage discount plans may have slightly higher base rates, the bill credits can compensate for the difference, especially if you consistently hit the usage milestones.\n\n### Getting the Best Contract and Rates\n\n**Contract Tips**: The duration of your electricity contract can significantly impact your ability to secure discounts.\n\nWhile longer contracts may offer more appealing terms and discounts, it's important to consider potential changes in your energy usage over time.\n\n**Finding the Best Deals**: Monitoring trends in the Texas energy market can help you determine the optimal time to lock in a rate.\n\nTypically, electricity rates drop during the cooler spring and fall seasons.\n\n### Dodging Hidden Fees in Bill Credit Plans\n\n**Keeping an Eye Out for Hidden Fees**: Look for any sneaky charges that could nibble away at your savings.\n\nKeep an eye open for minimum usage charges or additional fees for high electricity use.\n\n**Understanding the Details**: Review your electricity contract to grasp all the nuances thoroughly.\n\nFocus particularly on the rates' structure, any base fees, and the fine points of the usage discounts.\n\n## Bill Credits FAQs\n\n**How do I tailor my electricity use for discounts?**\n\nPinpoint the major energy consumers in your home. Consider running appliances like washing machines during off-peak hours to take advantage of usage discounts.\n\n**What are typical discount thresholds in Texas?**\n\nThey typically begin at 1,000 kWh, with additional tiers at higher consumption levels, such as 2,000 kWh.\n\n**Are discounts available in all plan types?**\n\nPrimarily found in fixed-rate plans, though some variable-rate options also include them. It's always best to confirm with your provider.\n\n**How can I track my electricity use?**\n\nMany Texas providers offer online tools or apps for live usage tracking. You can also sign up for an account on Smart Meter Texas to access your usage in 15-minute increments.\n\n**Do green plans have similar discounts?**\n\nAbsolutely. Lots of renewable energy plans now come with attractive usage discounts.\n\nThese can be even more beneficial if you sync your high usage periods with times when green energy is plentiful.\n\n**Can I switch to a usage discount plan if I'm currently under contract with another provider?**\n\nIt depends on your current contract. Some providers may allow you to switch plans mid-contract, while others may charge an early termination fee.\n\nCheck with your current provider to understand your options.\n\n**Are there any fees associated with usage discount plans?**\n\nMost usage discount plans don't have any additional fees beyond the standard base charges and energy rates.\n\nHowever, carefully reviewing your contract and asking your provider about any hidden fees is always a good idea.\n\n## How to Choose the Best Bill Credits Company\n\nWant the best electricity for your home? Shop with your usage.\n\nHere's how ⤵️\n\n<WpBlock77727_CpVideoPopup />\n\n### Tips for Choosing the Right Company\n\nNow that you've explored the top companies for customer service and figured out how to shop based on your usage, here are some tips to help you make your choice:\n\n- Pick a plan based on your kWh usage: Know your energy consumption to choose a good fit without overpaying the plan. If you're new to the place and unsure about your usage, our [**kWh calculator**](https://comparepower.com/kwh-electricity-energy-usage-calculator/) can help.\n\n- Compare rates and contract lengths: Compare various plans to find one that matches your price and contract duration needs.\n\n- Watch out for hidden fees: Look into any additional charges, like penalties for early contract termination or minimum usage fees.\n\n- Hunt for special deals: Keep an eye on promotions or discounts that can lower your energy bills.\n\n- Consider green energy options: If eco-friendliness matters to you, search for plans powered by renewable energy.\n\n- Read customer reviews: Customer feedback can offer valuable insights into a company's service quality and customer satisfaction.\n\n- Ensure top-notch customer service: Choose a provider known for reliable support when needed.\n\n- Opt for plans with online account management: The convenience of handling your account online lets you stay informed and in control effortlessly.\n\n## Your Turn to Save\n\nReady to turn your energy usage into savings?\n\nCheck out our top picks for usage discount plans in Texas and start putting money back in your pocket today.\n\nGet more out of what you spend on electricity with these leading providers offering usage discounts and bill credits.\n\nIt's not just about footing the bill for power; it's about earning rewards for it.\n\nChoose the right plan, and every kWh you use turns into savings.\n\nThis way, your energy bill becomes a bit more manageable every month.\n\n<ZipcodeSearchbar zipcode=\"\" buttontext=\"Get Started\" classname=\"in_post\" prependText=\"Compare Rates Near You\" />\n",

Keep an eye on early termination fees and how renewals work.\n\nStaying informed about market trends can be super useful, especially when it's time to renew your plan.\n\n### Renewable Energy and Fixed-Rate Plans\n\nIn Texas, fixed-rate plans are starting to offer more renewable energy options, showing how the state's getting serious about going green.\n\nIt's a cool way for you to support the planet and enjoy predictable pricing at the same time.\n\n### Understanding Billing and Payments\n\nThe rate you pay for each unit of electricity stays the same, but your total bill could go up or down based on how much energy you use.\n\nProviders offer different ways to pay, just watch out for any sneaky extra charges, like late fees.\n\n### The Regulatory Scene in Texas\n\nThe Texas energy scene is kept in check by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).\n\nThey're the referees making sure everything's fair and square for customers in a market where competition is king.\n\nThanks to deregulation, you've got lots of fixed-rate plan options to choose from, and these regulators are there to make sure the rates you see are clear and fair.\n\n## Fixed-Rates FAQs\n\n**What happens if I need to cancel my plan early?**\n\nMost fixed-rate plans come with an early termination fee if you bail out before your contract is up.\n\nMake sure to peek at your contract for the details on how much you might have to pay if you need to cancel early.\n\n**How do I know if a fixed-rate plan is right for me?**\n\nFixed-rate plans are great if you want predictable pricing and don't mind committing to a contract.\n\nIf you value flexibility or think energy prices might drop, a variable or indexed plan might be a better fit.\n\nThink about your needs and compare plans to find the best match.\n\n**Are there any hidden fees I should watch out for?**\n\nSome plans might have sneaky fees for things like late payments, not using enough energy, or canceling early.\n\nRead the fine print and ask questions before signing up to avoid surprises on your bill.\n\n**What sets my fixed rate?**\n\nYour fixed rate is influenced by things like how much it costs to produce energy and the pricing strategy of your provider at the time you sign up.\n\n**Do fixed rates shift over time?**\n\nYour rate won't change during your contract, but when it's time to renew, the rates for new contracts could vary based on the market at that time.\n\n## How to Choose Your Fixed-Rate Plan\n\nCheck out the contract length, any fees involved, and how good the provider is at customer service.\n\nSome plans might even throw in extras like green energy options. Choose a plan that fits your energy needs and budget perfectly.\n\nWe know you might be worried about getting stuck with a plan that doesn't fit your needs or comes with surprise fees.\n\nDon't stress.

Choosing it in Texas means you're reducing harmful emissions and supporting the growth of clean energy industries.\n\nIt's a simple way to make a positive impact on the planet.\n\n### How Do We Get Green Electricity?\n\nGreen electricity harnesses the Earth's natural forces.\n\nSolar panels capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. Wind turbines spin with the breeze to generate power. Hydroelectric plants use the flow of water for energy.\n\nThere are no harmful emissions involved, just clean, renewable energy.\n\nWith its abundant sunshine and wind, Texas is a prime location for renewable energy, making us a leader in the field.\n\n### What's the Deal with Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)?\n\nRECs are basically proof that renewable energy has been added to the grid. When you get a megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity from renewable sources, that's what a REC represents.\n\nChoosing a green plan often means you're buying RECs, ensuring that the electricity you use is matched by renewable energy on the grid.\n\n### Why Go Green?\n\nSwitching to green electricity helps protect our planet and could even help stabilize your energy bills. Renewable sources tend to stay more stable under market pressure, unlike their fossil fuel counterparts.\n\n### Who Should Go Green?\n\nGoing green is perfect for anyone looking to reduce their environmental impact. It's ideal for homeowners, eco-conscious individuals, and businesses pursuing sustainability goals.\n\nJust keep an eye on prices because some green plans cost more than other plans.\n\n### Getting the Most from Green Energy at Home\n\nTo maximize the benefits of your green energy plan, combine it with energy-efficient practices and technology.\n\nStart by switching to energy-efficient lighting and appliances and check out smart home technology, such as programmable thermostats and energy monitoring systems.\n\nWant to dive deeper into green electricity?\n\nCheck out our rundown on [Green Renewable Energy in Texas](https://comparepower.com/green-renewable-energy-companies-plans-rates/)\n\n## How to Choose the Best Electricity Company\n\nWant to find the best electricity company for your home?

We're here to be your guide, every step of the way.\n\n### Electricity Pricing 101\n\nElectricity prices in Texas are influenced by supply and demand in the market, the cost of fuels used to generate electricity, and regulations.\n\nUnderstanding these factors is like having a secret decoder ring for price changes. It empowers you to find more affordable options.\n\n### How Contract Length Affects Your Rates\n\nThe length of your electricity contract can significantly influence your rate. Longer contracts often boast lower prices, but they may limit your ability to switch plans if your needs change.\n\nOn the flip side, shorter contracts might come with slightly higher rates but offer the freedom to change plans if a more appealing deal appears on your radar.\n\n### Saving Big with Time-of-Use Plans\n\nIf you're willing to shift your electricity use, a time-of-use plan could be your budget's best friend.\n\nThese plans offer different prices based on when you use electricity.\n\nBy moving your high-consumption activities to off-peak hours when electricity costs less, you could see major savings on your bill.\n\n### Going Green Without Going Over Budget\n\nRenewable energy plans, sourced from green options like wind or solar, are becoming increasingly affordable.\n\nThey tend to offer more stable rates since they're less impacted by the ups and downs of fossil fuel markets. That's a win for your wallet and the planet.\n\n### Timing Your Rate Lock-In\n\nElectricity prices fluctuate throughout the year, with the best deals often popping up in spring and fall.\n\nKeeping an eye on these seasonal patterns can help you snag a lower rate when the timing is just right.\n\n### Dodging Hidden Fees\n\nBe a fee-fighting hero by watching out for sneaky charges hidden in electricity plans.\n\nThese can include connection or disconnection fees, monthly service charges, and even penalties for not using enough electricity.\n\nThose little extras can really sneak up on your bill.\n\n## Low Usage FAQs\n\n**How can I find the cheapest electricity rates in Texas.**\n\nThe key is to shop around, compare plans from different providers, consider your ideal contract length, and watch for special promotions. Staying informed about market conditions can also help you jump on the best rates.\n\n**How frequently do electricity rates change in Texas, and what's the best way to stay in the know.**\n\nTexas electricity prices can change with the seasons or when market conditions shift. A fixed-rate plan can provide some stability. For the latest prices, keep checking ComparePower—we'll make sure you're always in the loop.\n\n**Can I negotiate a lower electricity rate with providers.**\n\nNegotiating one-on-one with providers isn't common, but you can definitely choose a plan that fits your budget and your energy needs.\n\n**Are electricity rates lower at certain times of the year.**\n\nYou bet. Rates often drop in spring and fall when demand is lower. That's the perfect time to lock in a wallet-friendly plan.\n\n**Will choosing a longer contract get me a lower electricity rate.**\n\nIn many cases, yes. Longer contracts usually mean lower rates, but keep in mind that you might have less flexibility to switch plans if the market changes.\n\n**What's the best way to secure a low rate for the long haul.**\n\nFixed-rate plans are your friends when it comes to stable, low rates. Just be sure to review the contract carefully to dodge any surprise rate hikes.\n\n## Strategies to Secure the Best Company\n\nTo secure the best electricity deals, think like a savvy shopper.\n\nWhile the price per kWh is important, it's not the whole picture.\n\nTake into account the contract length, the provider's customer service track record, and feedback from other customers.\n\nWant the best electricity company for your home. Shop with your usage.\n\nHere's how ⤵️\n\n<WpBlock77727_CpVideoPopup />\n\n### Tips for Picking the Perfect Plan\n\nNow that you know how to shop based on your usage, here are some tips to help you choose the perfect plan for your needs and budget:\n\n- Use your kWh usage as your guide: Understanding your energy consumption helps you pick a plan that meets your needs without making you overspend.

By using less electricity, you're saving money and doing your part to help the environment.\n\nThat's a win-win in our book. So, what does it mean to be a low electricity user in Texas?\n\nWell, you're on the right track if you're using way less than the average Texan household, which uses about 1,176 kWh a month.\n\nThis could mean living in a cozy space, using appliances that don't consume too much power, and being thoughtful about how you use energy.\n\nIt's important to note that while low-usage plans can offer significant savings, they may come with some limitations or drawbacks.\n\nFor example, you might face higher per-kWh rates if you exceed a certain usage threshold or are subject to minimum usage requirements.\n\nBe sure to carefully review any plan's terms to ensure they align with your needs and consumption habits.\n\n### Why Bother with Low Electricity Usage?\n\nGoing low on electricity usage is a win-win.

But it's not so complicated once you know a few key things. Let's break it down!\n\nThis shake-up has sparked plenty of competition, leading to a buffet of plan options, prices, and customer service levels.\n\nHere's the deal with Texas electricity: You get to pick your Retail Electric Provider (REP) - they're the ones who set up your plan, decide your prices, and send you bills.\n\nBut here's the twist: They don't actually bring the electricity to your house. That job belongs to the Transmission and Distribution Utilities (TDUs).\n\nSo while you can shop around for REPs all day long, the folks keeping your lights on and fixing power lines when things go haywire? That's your local TDU, and they're the same no matter which REP you go with.\n\nHere's a quick guide to navigating the [**Texas deregulated energy**](https://comparepower.com/what-is-energy-choice/) scene to find what works best for you:\n\n**Power to Choose**: Texas's open market means you have the [**power to choose**](https://comparepower.com/power-to-choose-texas/) your electricity provider based on what's important to you, whether that's price, contract length, customer service, or green energy options.\n\n**Plan Types**: You'll find a mix of [**fixed-rate and variable-rate**](https://comparepower.com/fixed-rate-vs-variable-rate-electricity/) plans. Fixed-rate plans mean your price stays the same for a certain period, offering stability. Variable-rate plans change with the market, which could save you money when rates drop.\n\n**Going Green**: Many providers in Texas have [**green energy plans**](https://comparepower.com/green-renewable-energy-companies-plans-rates/) that use wind, solar, or water energy. Opting for one of these plans is a great way to support renewable energy.\n\n**Compare to Save**: Shopping around is the secret to landing the best deal. Compare different plans and rates from several companies to find the perfect fit.\n\n**Bill Breakdown**: Understanding your [**electric bill**](https://comparepower.com/charges-electric-bill/) is crucial. It usually includes energy costs, transmission fees, and extra charges or taxes. Understanding this can help you compare deals better.\n\n**Contract Lengths**: **[Electricity contracts](https://comparepower.com/short-term-vs-long-term-electricity-contract-lengths/)** can range from flexible month-to-month plans to longer commitments. Consider what suits your lifestyle, and watch for early termination fees if you switch before your contract ends.\n\nWith these points in mind, you can navigate the Texas energy market like a pro and choose an electricity plan that fits your needs and budget.
